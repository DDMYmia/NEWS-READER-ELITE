Apple’s “regular” earbuds were given a long overdue spruce-up in 2024, offering the option of ANC on the non-Pro AirPods for the first time, as well as an improved design and better sound quality.</p> \n<p>Whether you go for the ANC or entry level model, you’ll benefit from the various features afforded by the H2 audio chip. These include Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, Personalized Volume and Adaptive EQ. The AirPods 4 with ANC add Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and a Transparency mode to the spec sheet.</p> \n<p>Downsides? You still can’t change the volume using onboard controls, and the cheaper AirPods 4 don’t come with a case that supports wireless charging via MagSage or Qi, which is a disappointment. The AirPods Pro 4 with ANC do a pretty good job of banishing low-frequency background noise, but the noise-canceling capabilities aren't quite as strong as what you get with the AirPods Pro 2.</p> \n<p><em>Check out our coverage of the </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html\"><em>best Apple deals</em></a><em> for more discounts, and follow </em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/apples-airpods-4-are-up-to-33-percent-off-right-now-141631725.html?src=rss",

Senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford argued the company \"has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana\" thanks to the reductions in overall size and thickness on the Z Fold 7, making the niche handset appeal to more users. \"With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight,\" <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html\">he said</a>.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-canon-r50-v\">Canon R50 V</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"ba0bfdcd022b40348dc79fd5e31f585c\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Canon-RF-S14-30mm-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Live-Streaming/dp/B0F2523BMZ/ref=sr_1_1?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Content creators who are just getting into vlogging will soon realize they need a camera more robust than their phone for better quality footage. Reporter Steve Dent explained that Canon's EOS R50 V excels at video, thanks in part to its quick autofocus, but the camera lacks the performance and features of its rivals. \"Canon’s R50 V is a pretty good first try for a vlogging camera, hitting the mark in key areas like video quality and usability,\" <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/canon-r50-v-review-an-affordable-vlogging-camera-that-lags-behind-its-rivals-173028892.html\">he wrote</a>. \"However, its rival, Sony’s ZV-E10 II, beats it in nearly every area, offering even better video quality, higher photo resolution, faster autofocus, smoother electronic stabilization and neat features missing on the R50 V — like the product showcase.\"</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-samsung-hw-qs700f\">Samsung HW-QS700F</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"f22a67a8b5d04ae28d8678a492b412a0\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-HW-QS700F-Subwoofer-Convertible-Q-Symphony/dp/B0DY1WPJH6?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>Like the Z Fold line, Samsung has been on a streak of iterative updates for its flagship soundbars. For 2025 though, the company debuted an all-new model that automatically detects how you're using it and adjusts the speaker output appropriately.

Their mission was to take their knowledge of designing and building some of the world’s fastest cars to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bos-sublime-e-scooter-of-the-future-is-finally-ready-to-buy-070008363.html\">build a better e-scooter</a>. But while they no longer work for a Formula One team, they can’t quite shake that desire to build vehicles that travel at preposterously daft speed. Which is why the company has today unveiled <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://bo.world/pages/turbo\">The Turbo</a>, a souped-up version of the standard Bo e-scooter with a potential top speed of more than 100 miles per hour and a range of up to 150 miles.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/29807bd0-63d7-11f0-be2b-602bafabe19a\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/29807bd0-63d7-11f0-be2b-602bafabe19a\" style=\"height:2097px;width:3167px;\" alt=\"Image of the Bo Turbo on Bonneville Salt Flats\" data-uuid=\"1038dcf8-653a-328c-9c26-59399bde65b6\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Bo Mobility</div></figure>\n<p>The Turbo (surely, the Tur…Bo, <em>non?</em>) is equipped with a 24,000W dual-motor engine, and a 1,800Wh battery. Naturally, given Bo’s focus on safety and balance, the scooter has F1-style air intakes to keep both the electronics and brakes nicely cool. Given the scooter’s light weight, Bo claims it has a higher power to weight ratio than a hypercar like the Bugatti Veyron. It’s already been tested by former professional BMX rider Tre Whyte. Although he hasn’t quite yet been able to breach the 100mph barrier the company thinks that isn’t far off.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Of course, the Turbo is one way to pull the world’s eyeballs to a product, especially as it’s announcing the US availability of its scooters. Customers in the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://bo.world/\">US can now order a Bo M</a>, with vehicles available at some point in August 2025. If you want the standard Bo M, with a range of 25 miles, will set you back $1,990 while the M2, with a range pushing 40 miles, will cost $2,490. And, if you’re the sort of person who thinks that owning a scooter that can go at road car speeds is a good idea, you’ll actually be able to buy a Turbo: It’ll cost you at least $29,500, with the first delivery going to a collector in Madrid next year ahead of that city&#39;s inaugural grand prix.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/this-is-the-daftest-e-scooter-in-the-world-131341641.html?src=rss",

Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For gamers, there are also <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">gaming headsets</a> that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.</p> \n<p>Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.</p> \n<p>Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-headphones\">How we test noise-canceling headphones</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.</p> \n<p>ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-noise-canceling-headphones-we-tested\">Other noise-canceling headphones we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-airpods-max\">AirPods Max</h3> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html\">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancelation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for those with Apple devices. There are better options available at lower prices.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-ace\">Sonos Ace</h3> \n<p>The <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html\">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-beats-studio-pro\">Beats Studio Pro</h3> \n<p>The <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html\">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noise-canceling-headphones-faqs\">Noise-canceling headphones FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-block-all-noise\">Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3> \n<p>Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-wired-vs-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones\">Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?</h3> \n<p>In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-impact-sound-quality\">Does noise cancellation impact sound quality?</h3> \n<p>ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

Devices need to have good battery life (at least a full day’s use), bright inner displays (peaks of at least 1,000 nits), sharp cameras and responsive performance. That said, foldable phones come in different shapes (and sizes); there are varying designs that may appeal to different types of people.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For those who prefer more compact and stylish devices, flip phone-style foldables resemble old-school namesakes but with flexible interior displays (typically six to seven inches diagonally) and smaller outer screens, often referred to as the cover display. Alternatively, for power users and people who want to maximize mobile productivity, there are larger book-style foldables (with seven to eight-inch main displays) that can transform from a candy bar-style phone to essentially a small tablet when opened.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-are-foldable-phones-worth-it-a-note-on-durability\">Are foldable phones worth it? A note on durability</h2> \n<p>Aside from their displays, the biggest difference between foldable phones and more traditional handsets is durability. That’s because while some models like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung’s foldables offer IPX8 water resistance (which is good for submersions of up to five feet for 30 minutes), their flexible screens – which are largely made from plastic – present some unique challenges.</p> \n<p>Most foldables come with factory-installed screen protectors. However, unlike regular phones, users are instructed not to remove them without assistance from approved service centers. Thankfully, Samsung phones do offer one free screen protector replacement for its foldables, while Google charges between $29 and $129 depending on the warranty status of your device. That said, while we can’t do long-term testing for every new foldable phone on the market, after personally using the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 each for a year, I’ve found that Samsung’s pre-installed screen protector tends to start bubbling nine to 12 months after purchase. So you’ll probably want to factor in that your foldable may need some sort of servicing after about a year unless you plan on removing the screen protector entirely (which is possible, but goes against most manufacturers' instructions).</p> \n<p>Furthermore, foldable phone owners need to be mindful about keeping sharp objects away from their flexible displays, as rocks, keys or even pressing down very hard with a fingernail can leave permanent marks. In the event that you need to get a flexible screen serviced, you’re potentially facing a much higher repair bill when compared to a typical phone (up to $500 or more depending on the model and the severity of the damage). In short, while the ruggedness of foldable phones has improved a lot, they're still more delicate than traditional handsets, which is something you need to account for.</p> \n<p>However, foldables continue to evolve, with better AI features, improved specs and a more refined form factors that makes them even more practical. Whether you’re after a flip phone for nostalgia or a big screen device for multitasking, today’s foldable phones offer exciting possibilities — you just have to decide if they’re the right fit for you.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-foldable-phone-faqs\">Foldable phone FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-a-foldable-phone-and-a-flip-phone\">What is the difference between a foldable phone and a flip phone?</h3> \n<p>Foldable and flip phones both use flexible displays, but the way they fold — and what that means for usability — is different. A foldable phone typically opens like a book, giving you a larger tablet-like screen inside, which is great for multitasking or media. A flip phone, on the other hand, folds vertically to become more compact, kind of like the classic clamshell phones of the early 2000s. Flip phones are more pocket-friendly, while foldables offer more screen real estate when open.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-disadvantage-of-a-foldable-phone\">What is the disadvantage of a foldable phone?</h3> \n<p>The biggest trade-offs with foldable phones are price and durability. They're often more expensive than traditional smartphones, thanks to the complex hinge mechanisms and flexible displays. Battery life can sometimes take a hit too, especially with larger screens. And while the tech has come a long way, foldables can still be a bit bulkier and not quite as seamless as regular slab phones when it comes to everyday use.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-are-foldable-phones-less-durable-than-other-phones\">Are foldable phones less durable than other phones?</h3> \n<p>Generally, yes — at least for now. Foldable phones use flexible displays and intricate hinges, which can be more prone to wear and tear over time compared to standard phones with solid glass screens. That said, newer models have gotten tougher with improved hinge designs, water resistance and stronger ultra-thin glass. They're definitely more durable than they used to be, but they still require a bit more care than your average smartphone.</p> \n<p><em>Georgie Peru contributed to this report.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>Apple announces the new additions to its smartphone lineup in the fall, and the iPhone 17 is the upcoming collection. We learned a lot about what to expect on the software side during the company's WWDC presentation, but there have also been several leaks and rumors about the hardware side ahead of the phones' official introduction. Here's what we know and what we're expecting from Cupertino this autumn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. It's a little early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\"><ins>split</ins></a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\"><ins>indicated</ins></a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple shakes up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">a surprisingly high price point</a>, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. <em>Bloomberg</em> said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em><ins>Macworld</ins></em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on iOS 26.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\"><ins>scaling down</ins></a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\"><ins>freeze FaceTime video</ins></a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls.

If you're interested in Bravo and whatever shows are exclusive to Peacock, you can pay $8 and get a huge library of episodes to watch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/like-clockwork-peacock-is-raising-subscription-prices-again-203644730.html?src=rss",

These features will be available to Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra subscribers. Although both of these tools can still be accessed through other means, Google's move to incorporate them into the chatbot points to an end goal of AI Mode being the primary form of engagement with the company's signature search service.</p>\n<p>These developments are follow-ups to announcements made during Google's I/O conference this spring.

    "summary": "<p>There&#39;s finally a full trailer for <em>Tron: Ares</em>, the third installment in the decades-long sci-fi franchise. This comes after a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KVG_X_7Naw\">teaser dropped a few months back</a> and over two years after the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tron-3-jared-leto-disney-movie-192711855.html\">film was first announced</a>.</p>\n<p>The new footage is pretty cool, and gets into the meat of this threequel. It&#39;s a riff on AI and big tech, as corporate entities look to weaponize the digital creations of The Grid and bring them to the real world. This does not go well, as evidenced by shots of iconic franchise Recognizer ships careening down city streets.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"03c22e8ef53d44c3a8974672c29fc2d0\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YShVEXb7-ic?si=KpEMJICpiZOfWMTQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>It also features Jeff Bridges, returning as computer programmer Kevin Flynn. Bridges is the only actor who will have appeared in all three Tron films. The star of this new one, however, is the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nbcwashington.com/video/news/national-international/video-jared-leto-denies-sexual-misconduct-allegations/3939270/\">scandal-plagued Jared Leto</a>, who plays a soldier from The Grid who has traveled to the real world on some kind of mission. Hasan Minhaj, Gillian Anderson, Greta Lee and Evan Peters are also in the movie.</p>\n<p><em>Tron: Ares</em> is directed by Joachim Rønning, who is something of a Disney hired gun. He made <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</em> and <em>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</em>, among other films for the company.</p>\n<p>I really have no idea what to make of this movie, even if the footage looks pretty nifty. I love the original and like the sequel well enough. One thing I&#39;m happy about is the continued dedication to atmosphere-soaked soundtracks. The first film featured an iconic score by Wendy Carlos and the folks behind <em>Tron: Legacy</em> hired Daft Punk to make the music. The new movie includes a soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails. The band released the first single today, likely to coincide with the trailer, and it definitely nails the vibe.</p>\n<div id=\"209cf6a129594652945dd969e0107a60\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Sj-FmI5JfA?si=7zkdG_ohhTYNylv8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>We don&#39;t have that long to wait for this one. <em>Tron: Ares</em> opens in theaters on October 10.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/the-official-tron-ares-trailer-riffs-on-big-tech-and-features-a-returning-jeff-bridges-181232528.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>After five years of development, one of Steam&#39;s coziest games is leaving Steam early access and making the jump to consoles. Starting today, you can purchase <em>The Wandering Village </em>on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/\">PC</a>, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-wandering-village-switch/\">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"http://store.playstation.com/product/JP6400-PPSA24938_00-0605130831842075\">PlayStation 5</a>. On Steam, the game&#39;s developer, Stray Fawn Studio, is offering a 35 percent discount until July 31. In the US, that means you can get the game for just under $20. Switch owners, meanwhile, can get a 10 percent launch discount until August 7.</p>\n<div id=\"8c24c032c62d434e9ace13fa630db8f5\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eczlXmiEsUI?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I&#39;ve been playing <em>The Wandering Village </em>on and off since it entered early access in 2022. It&#39;s a lovely game that combines two very different influences. Most obviously, the game wears on its sleeve Stray Fawn&#39;s love of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s seminal <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://youtu.be/zaskbIZtfxQ?si=Kec3yrBEm98c-mxY\"><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em></a>. The manga and later film is set in a desolate, post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear war.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>The Wandering Village&#39;s </em>other major influence are the titles of Impressions Games. In the late &#39;90s and early 2000s, the now-defunct studio went on a hot streak  releasing three games — <em>Caesar III, Pharaoh</em> and <em>Zeus: Master of Olympus</em> — that, to this day, define much of the city-building genre.</p>\n<p><em>The Wandering Village </em>marries those influences in a novel way. Rather than building your city on solid ground, you build it on the back of a giant creature called the Onbu. As you can probably guess, the Onbu doesn&#39;t stay still. And while there are ways you can influence its behavior, sometimes it can have a mind of its own. All of that leads to some interesting gameplay interactions. For example, the Onbu might wander into a biome that is toxic to your villagers. As of the writing of this article, the game has a &quot;very positive&quot; rating on Steam on nearly 6,000 reviews, with recent reviews tilting toward &quot;overwhelming positive.&quot;</p>\n<p>If you want to grab a physical copy of the game for Switch or PS5, Stray Fawn has partnered with <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.serenityforge.com/collections/wandering-village\">Serenity Forge</a> to offer collectors and premium editions of the game. Pre-orders will ship early next year. Despite the game leaving early access, Stray Fawn has promised to keep working <em>The Wandering Village</em>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/one-of-my-favorite-steam-early-access-games-is-now-available-on-switch-and-ps5-174539016.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>You might already have a good idea of which smartphone you want to be your next one. But there are more solid options available now than ever before, making the decision not as cut-and-dry as it used to be. While the decision is a bit easier if you know you want an iPhone, there's even enough variation between those new models that you may have to think about it longer than you anticipated. If you’re an Android person, you have even more options to choose from — including <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-foldable-phones-160030013.html\">foldables</a> — and more questions to answer before you spend any money.<br><br>At Engadget, we review phones regularly and have tested dozens over the years. Whether you’ve had your eye on one of our current top picks, one of Samsung's Galaxy S25 phones, a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html\">cheap phone</a> or another device, we’re here to help you decide which is the best phone to buy this year.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-android-or-ios\">Android or iOS?</h2> \n<p>When you're searching for the best smartphone, it becomes clear that each OS has its pros and cons. Apple’s tight-knit ecosystem makes it super easy to share data between iPhones, iPads and Macs or seamlessly hand-off phone calls or music from one device to another. At the same time, you’re effectively locked in, as services like Apple Messages aren’t available on other platforms.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>As for Android, there’s a much wider range of handsets from companies like Google, Samsung, Sony and more. However, Android phones don’t enjoy that same length of software support and often have lower trade-in values. In short, there’s no wrong answer. However, you will want to consider how your phone will fit in with the rest of your devices. So unless you’re really fed up with one OS and willing to learn another, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone (or vice versa) – especially if everyone else in your household is using the same platform.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras\">Cameras</h2> \n<p>Since your cell phone often pulls double duty as your primary camera, figuring out what kind of photo tools you want is key. Nowadays, practically every mobile phone can take a great picture in bright light. But if you want a long optical zoom, you’ll probably have to upgrade to a more expensive device.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91a42bf0-305d-11ec-9f9f-636d29742095\" alt=\"Close up of the Pixel 6 Pro's camera bump.\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Cherlynn Low / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html\">Mid-range phones</a> often only have two rear cameras (a primary wide-angle lens and a secondary ultra-wide camera) and can sometimes struggle in low-light situations. Each phone maker also has various features that might be a better fit for your style, with Apple offering four different color presets on the latest iPhones, while Google’s Pixel 9 Pro comes with neat tools like dedicated long exposure and Action Pan modes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-will-you-get-mmwave-5g-or-wi-fi-7\">Will you get mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7?</h2> \n<p>The good news is that in 2025, most phones have at least Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6e and support for some kind of 5G connectivity. However, if you want the fastest wireless speeds possible, it’s going to cost you a little extra. For example, on certain networks, mmWave 5G offers up to gigabit download speeds, less latency and better bandwidth. But mmWave 5G also requires more sophisticated (and pricier) modems, which means support for it is often missing on less expensive devices.</p> \n<p>On the bright side, mmWave 5G isn’t as widely available as other versions of 5G, so depending on where you live and what network you’re on, you may not be missing out on much right now if you buy a phone that doesn’t support it. It’s a similar situation for Wi-Fi 7, which is available on some high-end handsets like the Galaxy S25, but harder to find on cheaper devices. Wi-Fi 7 also requires you to have a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/linksys-releases-its-first-ever-wi-fi-7-mesh-router-system-160053926.html\">compatible router</a>, so unless you know you need it or have a specific use case in mind, the lack of support for mmWave 5G or Wi-Fi 7 shouldn’t be a dealbreaker when looking for a new phone.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-features-to-consider\">Other features to consider</h2> \n<p>Because not everyone agrees on what makes the best phone, you should think about any other specs that might be extra important for you. Mobile gamers will almost certainly appreciate the 120Hz refresh rates you get on phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Apple iPhone 16 Pro. Alternatively, if long battery life is important, you’ll probably want to go with a larger iPhone or an Android phone with a battery that’s between 4,000 and 5,000 mAh in size. Meanwhile, if you find yourself juggling a lot of devices, it can be really nice to have a phone that supports reverse wireless charging, which on Samsung phones even lets you recharge the company’s Galaxy Watches.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"1da6e07c962e4140824f8e003c8aec30\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16-pro\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"7607984f58b64995a0e8ccedb63b0cfa\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://store.google.com/us/config/pixel_9_pro?\" data-original-url-76079-btn-0=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0DBSLDYGK/?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"f18b51cf1c8346398ac36a5086299850\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"ceca1ca604c24c3eafce8efb8361a0e5\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHV7N4X/?th=1\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"52c97ffde27a4dddad921d47af754a78\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7K9LFCL/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"ed1747b6fe454a518d5d55731ee738a6\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Camcorder-Interpreter-Manufacturer/dp/B0D195JKYD\"></core-commerce></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-smartphones-weve-tested\">Other smartphones we've tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra\">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h3> \n<p>Like its predecessor, the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-too-much-ai-not-enough-ultra-140022798.html\">S25 Ultra</a> is an incredibly versatile phone. It’s one of the few handsets that come with an included stylus and premium features like a gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED display, titanium frame and a 5x telephoto camera. It also has excellent performance and strong battery life. The issue is that, aside from improved AI, this year’s phone doesn’t offer that much more than the previous model (or the one before that), and with prices starting at $1,300, we feel it needs to do more to earn a top pick spot.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-oneplus-13\">OnePlus 13</h3> \n<p>While the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html\">OnePlus 13</a> features some basic AI features like Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, it’s really just an old-fashioned flagship in all the best ways. That’s because instead of focusing on machine learning, OnePlus crammed the phone with tons of top-notch hardware. It sports a 6.8-inch OLED display with an incredible peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits. The OP13 also offers excellent performance thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are also three 50-MP rear cameras including one with a 3x telephoto zoom and a massive 6,000 mAh battery that’s bigger than what you get in practically all of its competitors.</p> \n<p>OnePlus didn’t skimp on the phone’s design either, as the OP13 still comes with the company’s signature Alert Slider. Plus, if you opt for the blue or white variants, you’ll get a durable and very touchable vegan leather back that helps the phone stand out among all its glass brick rivals. But the best part is that starting at $900, it costs less than an equivalent Galaxy S25+ too.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-faqs\">FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-i-know-which-smartphone-is-the-best-for-me\">How do I know which smartphone is the best for me?</h3> \n<p>While choosing the best smartphone can be challenging, it mostly comes down to how you plan on using the device. All of the best phones available now get the basics right — you’ll be able to make calls, text and access the internet without many hiccups. If your smartphone is your most used gadget, you may want to consider paying for a device on the higher end of the price spectrum. That will get you better overall performance, higher-quality cameras and a phone that will last for many years. If you don’t use your phone for everything, you may be able to compromise on performance and extra perks and spend less on a still-capable handset.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-much-is-a-smartphone\">How much is a smartphone?</h3> \n<p>Smartphones range in price from $300 to over $1,500. The best budget phones available now will usually compromise on overall performance, design, camera prowess and extra features to keep costs down. On the flip side, the most expensive phones will have powerful processors, triple-camera arrays and even flip or fold designs. Most people will find a phone that fits their needs somewhere in the middle of that wide price range — we’ve found that most of the best smartphones available right now cost between $500 and $1,000.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-can-you-do-on-a-smartphone\">What can you do on a smartphone?</h3> \n<p>Smartphones are essentially small, portable computers that let you do things like check email, browse social media, follow map directions, make contactless payments and more. This is all on top of the basics like making phone calls and texting, which we’ve come to expect in all modern cell phones. Smartphones have also mostly replaced compact cameras thanks to their high-quality, built-in shooters, and the fact that most smartphones today as just as portable, if not more so, as compact cameras.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-long-do-smartphones-last\">How long do smartphones last?</h3> \n<p>Smartphones can last years and people are <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252524995/Smartphone-trade-value-rises-as-average-age-of-devices-breaks-35-year-threshold\">holding on to their phones</a> longer now than ever before. Software updates and battery life are two of the biggest factors that can affect phone longevity. Apple promises five years worth of software updates for its latest iPhones, and Google promises the same for its Pixel phones. Samsung phones will get four years worth of Android updates from the time they launch. As for charging speeds and battery life, your phone can deteriorate over time as you use and recharge your phone on a regular basis.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>July 2025:</strong> Updated to include the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p> \n<p><strong>April 2025:</strong> Updated to include the Google Pixel 9a.</p> \n<p><strong>February 2025:</strong> Updated to include the iPhone 16e.</p> \n<p><strong>January 2025:</strong> Updated to include details about Samsung's latest Galaxy S-series phones.</p> \n<p><strong>September 2024:</strong> Updated to include the latest iPhone 16 models and a new midrange iPhone top pick.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html?src=rss",

Dreier is the chief of space policy at <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/\">The Planetary Society</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for the exploration and study of space.</p>\n<p>On July 10, the Senate Appropriations Committee met to discuss the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/senators-signal-they-re-prepared-to-push-back-against-nasa-cuts\">proposed federal Commerce, Justice and Science budget for 2026</a>. While on average, funding for NASA has accounted for about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasa-budget\">0.3 percent</a> of total yearly spending by the federal government since the start of the 2010s, President Trump has called for a 24 percent cut year over year to the agency&#39;s operating allowance. By any metric, his plan would be devastating.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Adjusted for inflation, it would leave NASA with the smallest operating budget it has had since Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel to space in 1961. In the process, it would eviscerate the agency&#39;s science budget by nearly half, resulting in the termination of 55 ongoing and or planned missions. It would also leave NASA with its smallest workforce in 70 years. All this, at a time when the agency has been tasked with returning to the Moon and bringing the first humans to Mars.</p>\n<p>&quot;There&#39;s no historical precedent to this level of single year, functionally indiscriminate and dramatic cuts. You lose, in one year, a third of all active science projects. [The Trump administration is] proposing to turn off missions that are performing not just good science, but unique and irreplaceable science. This isn&#39;t so they can reinvest the money in some radical new science efforts. No, the money is gone,&quot; said Dreier. &quot;It&#39;s almost certainly the greatest threat to NASA science activities in the history of the space agency.&quot;</p>\n<p>Dreier isn&#39;t exaggerating when he says some missions would be impossible to replace. One of the casualties of Trump&#39;s cuts would be the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-11-new-horizons-probe-captures-images-at-record-distance.html\">New Horizons</a> probe. In 2015, New Horizons gave us our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-11-pluto-new-horizons-photos.html\">best look at Pluto</a> ever.

As things stand, it&#39;s the only active spacecraft in the Kuiper belt, a region of our solar system that is not well-understood by scientists. Even if NASA were to start working on a replacement today, it would take a generation for that vehicle to reach where New Horizons is right now. It costs NASA about <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-new-horizons\">$14.7 million</a> per year to continue operating the probe, a fraction of the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/press-release/congress-approves-unprecedented-funding-mass-detention-deportation-2025/\">$29.9 billion</a> in additional funding Congress allocated to fund ICE enforcement and detainment operations in the president&#39;s recently passed tax bill.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/1f1de800-c572-11ec-bdad-23dc08f97cb3\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/1f1de800-c572-11ec-bdad-23dc08f97cb3\" style=\"height:1280px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"OSIRIS-APEX probe visiting the Apophis asteroid\" data-uuid=\"85a67704-b113-378d-aba9-0d961b81563c\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Heather Roper</div></figure>\n<p>Another mission that would be impossible to replace is OSIRIS-APEX. If the name sounds familiar, it&#39;s because OSRIS-APEX is a continuation of NASA&#39;s incredibly successful <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-osiris-rex-bennu-sample-collection-221523176.html\">OSRIS-REx flight</a>. In 2020, the spacecraft visited <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids/101955-bennu/facts/\">101955 Bennu</a>, an ancient asteroid about the size of the Empire State Building, and collected a sample of regolith (rocks and dirt) from its surface using a never-before-tried technique.</p>\n<p>After OSRIS-REx successfully <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasas-osiris-rex-successfully-delivers-asteroid-samples-back-to-earth-091107901.html\">returned the sample to Earth</a>, NASA decided to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/osiris-rex-apex-apophis-asteroid-visit-154021788.html\">extend the spacecraft&#39;s mission</a> and fly to another asteroid, 99942 Apophis. In 2029, Apophis will pass about 19,600 miles from Earth. It will be the closest approach of any known asteroid of its size. NASA said the extension would add $200 million to a mission that had already cost it an estimated $1.16 billion.</p>\n<p>&quot;This project is a pennies on the dollar repurposing of an existing spacecraft. It&#39;s the only American spacecraft that will be at Apophis for a once in a generation opportunity to study an asteroid that will just barely miss us,&quot; said Dreier. &quot;That seems important to know.&quot;</p>\n<p>At a time when nearly every facet of American life is being upturned, the potential cancellation of dozens of NASA missions might seem a distant concern, but the gutting of the agency&#39;s science budget would have a ripple effect on communities across the US.</p>\n<p>&quot;NASA is an engine for jobs in the country, and for every NASA job, there are many more that are created in the private workforce,&quot; said Bethany Ehlmann, Professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology. She also serves on the board of directors for The Planetary Society.</p>\n<p>Professor Ehlmann&#39;s claim is supported by NASA&#39;s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/final-fy23-nasa-ecomomic-impact-report.pdf\">own data</a>. In 2023, the agency employed 17,823 full-time civil servants nationwide. With NASA&#39;s private sector support factored in, that year the agency&#39;s missions were responsible for sustaining 304,803 jobs across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Put another way, for every full-time equivalent job at a NASA facility, NASA supports at least 16 private sector jobs. &quot;Space science has been broadly supported and impacts roughly three quarters of every congressional district in the country,&quot; said Dreier. &quot;It&#39;s not just a red or blue state thing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Following last week&#39;s Senate meeting, policymakers from both parties said they would push back on President Trump&#39;s NASA budget cuts. On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee&#39;s Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/congress-moves-to-reject-bulk-of-white-houses-proposed-nasa-cuts/\">passed a funding bill</a> that would provide NASA with a total budget of $24.8 billion for 2026, or the same amount it was allocated this year. The week before, the corresponding subcommittee in the Senate passed its own NASA funding bill.</p>\n<p>The two versions differ on one critical detail. The Senate legislation maintains the agency&#39;s science budget at $7.3 billion, while the House version seeks to reduce it by 18 percent to $6 billion. Separately, the House is calling for a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/07/15/house-appropriators-propose-23-cut-nsf\">23 percent cut</a> to the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/\">National Science Foundation</a>&#39;s budget. NSF funds much of the nation&#39;s astronomy research.</p>\n<p>&quot;What I&#39;m hearing from lawmakers is that they understand how important NASA is to industry. They understand how important NASA is to universities in terms of training, and providing grants that train the next generation of the space workforce,&quot; said Professor Ehlmann, who was on Capitol Hill last week. The House and Senate will need to come to an agreement for the bill to move forward.</p>\n<p>Even with many lawmakers in favor of maintaining NASA&#39;s budget, a flat budget is still a funding cut when accounting for inflation. Moreover, NASA has already been negatively affected by the Trump administration&#39;s efforts to trim the federal workforce.</p>\n<p>According to reporting <a data-i13n=\"cpos:17;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/09/nasa-staff-departures-00444674\"><em>Politico</em></a> published on July 9, 2,694 NASA employees have agreed to leave the agency through either early retirement, a buyout or a deferred resignation. Of those individuals, 2,145 are workers in senior positions and 1,818 are staff serving in missions areas like human spaceflight and science. &quot;Once the workforce is gone, they&#39;re gone. You lose a ton of institutional knowledge,&quot; said Dreier. The employees who have agreed to leave represent about 15 percent of NASA&#39;s 2023 workforce of 17,823. With the July 25 deadline for early retirement, voluntary separation and deferred resignations quickly approaching, that number is likely to grow. NASA&#39;s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:18;pos:1\" href=\"https://spacenews.com/nasa-terminating-420-million-in-contracts/\">shifting priorities</a> under the Trump administration have also created uncertainty <a data-i13n=\"cpos:19;pos:1\" href=\"https://lailluminator.com/briefs/nasa-michoud/\">among the agency&#39;s contractors</a>.</p>\n<p>According to former NASA employee and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:20;pos:1\" href=\"https://nasawatch.com/\">NASA Watch</a> creator Keith Cowing the workforce cuts are already affecting employees. &quot;In the 40 years I&#39;ve been involved with NASA in one way or another, I&#39;ve never seen morale so bad,&quot; he said. &quot;Is NASA bloated? Yeah, but the way you deal with bloat is to go in with a scalpel and you cut carefully. And yet you have people [like Elon Musk] standing on stage with chainsaws. That is not the way to run government, and it&#39;s certainly not the way to create the machinery needed to explore the universe.&quot;</p>\n<p>Whatever happens next, Dreier worries there&#39;s the potential for there to be an erosion in public support for NASA. He points to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:21;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/07/20/americans-views-of-space-u-s-role-nasa-priorities-and-impact-of-private-companies/\">survey</a> published by Pew Research. In 2023, the organization found that monitoring for asteroids that could hit Earth and tracking changes to the planet&#39;s climate were the two activities Americans wanted NASA to prioritize over other mandates. By contrast, sending human astronauts to the Moon and Mars were the least important priorities for the public.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a81dfdd0-631b-11f0-9dfe-7792fe065fe3\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a81dfdd0-631b-11f0-9dfe-7792fe065fe3\" style=\"height:5464px;width:8192px;\" alt=\"NASA&#39;s next-generation moon rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with the Orion crew capsule, is readied for launch on pad 39-B, for the unmanned Artemis 1 mission to the Moon, at Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S. November 15, 2022.

That means making strategic decisions — including scaling back or discontinuing ineffective efforts not aligned with our Moon and Mars exploration priorities&quot; Petro wrote.</p>\n<p>The final NASA budget for 2026 is still months away from being finalized. After Tuesday&#39;s vote, the two funding bills will move to the full Senate and House appropriations committees for a vote and further revisions. Only after that will every member of each chamber get a chance to vote on the matter. Congress has until September 30 to complete the appropriations process before 2025 funding runs out. President Trump could also decide to veto the bill if it doesn&#39;t align with his priorities.</p>\n<p><em>Have a tip for Igor?

Uber’s partnership with EV manufacturer Lucid will see it deploy at least 20,000 of the Newark-based company’s vehicles over a period of six years. These will be equipped with the AI-powered Nuro Driver autonomous technology. The vehicles will be owned and operated by Uber or one of its third-party partners, and the service will be exclusive to Uber users.</p>\n<p>The robotaxi service is expected to launch in late 2026 in an unnamed &quot;major US city,&quot; and Uber <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2025/Lucid-Nuro-and-Uber-Partner-on-Next-Generation-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Program/default.aspx\"><ins>said</ins></a> that a prototype of an operational autonomous Lucid-Nuro vehicle is currently being tested on a closed circuit at a Nuro facility in Las Vegas.

The developers met on Nostr, a social networking protocol Dorsey has also backed financially.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The &quot;and Other Stuff&quot; collective aims to support Nostr&#39;s &quot;transition from an experimental protocol to a widely adopted, sustainable ecosystem through collaborative growth and funding.&quot; In addition to Nostr projects, the collaborators plan to experiment with building tools based on the likes of ActivityPub — which powers Mastodon — and Cashu. That e-cash platform&#39;s creator, dubbed Calle, is part of the &quot;and other Stuff&quot; team alongside Twitter’s first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath.</p>\n<p>The projects that &quot;and Other Stuff&quot; has worked on so far include voice note app heynow, a private messenger app called White Noise and social community +chorus. They have also created Shakespeare, which is designed to help developers build Nostr-based social apps with AI.</p>\n<p>Dorsey has long fostered an interest in open-source protocols. In 2019, during his second stint as Twitter CEO, the company <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html\"><ins>set up a team</ins></a> that was tasked with forming an open, decentralized standard for social media. Dorsey had hoped to eventually shift Twitter onto that protocol, but of course that didn&#39;t pan out. Instead, Twitter spun out that project — Bluesky — as a public benefit corporation in 2022. Last year, after leaving Bluesky&#39;s board, Dorsey claimed that the team there was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-claims-bluesky-is-repeating-all-the-mistakes-he-made-at-twitter-234326121.html\"><ins>&quot;literally repeating all the mistakes&quot;</ins></a> he made while running Twitter such as, uh, setting up moderation tools (which are, in reality, a critically important aspect of any successful social platform).</p>\n<p>On an episode of Henshaw-Plath&#39;s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS5JI-ksaXs\"><ins>new podcast</ins></a>, Dorsey reiterated a point he had made previously, that Twitter was beholden to advertisers (an issue that X is contending with <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-sues-advertisers-for-illegal-boycott-of-the-platform-173100888.html\"><ins>under Elon Musk&#39;s ownership</ins></a>). &quot;It’s hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,&quot; Dorsey said. &quot;If [Twitter] were an open protocol, if it were truly an open project, you could build a business on top of it, and you could build a very healthy business on top of it.&quot;</p>\n<p>He was also once again critical of Bluesky&#39;s structure, adding that, &quot;I want to push the energy in a different direction... which is more like Bitcoin, which is completely open and not owned by anyone from a protocol layer. That’s what I see in Nostr as well. That’s where I want to push my energy... rather into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jack-dorsey-backs-an-open-source-development-collective-with-10-million-140052825.html?src=rss",

But while the hope was that hydrogen could be a cleaner, greener substitute for oil and gas, its inherent flaws always made that a non-starter.</p>\n<p>For instance, hydrogen is far less energy dense than oil and gas, and far less physically dense — it’s so prone to leaking that you have to go above and beyond to seal it in. It’s difficult to mass produce cleanly, especially if you want to power every car in the world, unless you use a dirty process like the steam reformation of methane. So, rather than moving away from fossil fuels and emissions, you’d be further entrenching them into the system and adding to the problem.</p>\n<p>And if you did want to just use renewable energy to pull hydrogen from water, then you’d require an unprecedented amount of investment. Back in 2021, I asked Tim Lord, who had previously been in charge of the UK’s decarbonization strategy, about that sort of industrial-scale hydrogen generation. He said that you’d essentially need to double your whole <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/air-source-heat-pumps-uk-120044198.html\">electricity generation output</a> to get close.</p>\n<p>That’s before you get to the other factors, like hydrogen’s efficiency as a store of energy or the investment necessary to equip every gas station on the planet with a hydrogen tank. Which is not likely going to pay off given that Toyota’s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/toyota-second-generation-mirai-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle-060056654.html\">Mirai</a>, arguably the flagship hydrogen fuel cell EV, has only sold 28,000 models since its launch in 2014. In the US market, there&#39;s only the Mirai, the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-hyundai-nexo-fuel-cell-ev-hands-on.html\">Hyundai Nexo</a> and the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/honda-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicle-cr-v-us-production-date-171022280.html\">Honda CR-V e-FCEV</a> knocking around, nothing compared to how many BEVs are on sale. I think it’s time for everyone to admit that we’re done with hydrogen fuel cell EVs and focus their attention elsewhere.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/another-big-car-company-gives-up-on-hydrogen-133011978.html?src=rss",

TikTok noted that several established songwriters including Lauren Christy (Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears), Toby Gad (Fergie, John Legend) and Justin Tranter (Dua Lipa, Ariana Grande) are among the first to gain access. Others who want to join can put their names on a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://wj.tiktokv-us.com/q/73312/43273GJS/7c54/#/\">waitlist</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>TikTok and its parent ByteDance developed the Songwriter Features after surveying 871 songwriters and doing 18 in-depth interviews.

The platform noted that 53 percent of full-time songwriters who post content on social media do so on TikTok.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When it comes to royalties and copyright, TikTok has taken a similar tack to YouTube and other social media sites. All the music available on TikTok can be used in videos and the platform has deals in place with distributors and labels to license music.

    "summary": "<p>Since rolling out the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobes-new-ai-agent-can-show-you-how-to-use-photoshop-090049772.html\">redesign of its Firefly app in April</a>, Adobe has been releasing major updates for the generative AI hub at a near monthly clip. Today, the company is introducing a handful of new features to assist those who use Firefly&#39;s video capabilities.</p>\n<p>To start, Adobe is making it easier to add sound effects to AI-generated clips. Right now, the majority of video models create footage without any accompanying audio. Adobe is addressing this with a nifty little feature that allows users to first describe the sound effect they want to generate and then record themselves making it. The second part isn&#39;t so Adobe&#39;s model can mimic the sound. Rather, it&#39;s so the system can get a better idea of the intensity and timing the user wants from the effect.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In the demo Adobe showed me, one of the company&#39;s employees used the feature to add the sound of a zipper being unzipped. They made a &quot;zzzztttt&quot; sound, which Adobe&#39;s model faithfully used to reproduce the effect at the intended volume. The translation was less convincing when the employee used the tool to add the sound of footsteps on concrete, though if you&#39;re using the feature for ideation as Adobe intended, that may not matter. When adding sound effects, there&#39;s a timeline editor along the bottom of the interface to make it easy to time the audio properly.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/81b13b90-627f-11f0-aaad-131e57872183\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/81b13b90-627f-11f0-aaad-131e57872183\" style=\"height:1440px;width:2560px;\" alt=\"With Firefly&#39;s June update, users can upload images or videos to guide their video generation. \" data-uuid=\"b8afaf58-1bc3-359b-b1da-43e8b181268f\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Adobe</div></figure>\n<p>The other new features Adobe is adding today are called Composition Reference, Keyframe Cropping and Video Presets. The first of those allows you to upload a video or image you captured to guide the generation process. In combination with Video Presets, you can define the style of the final output. Some of the options Adobe is offering at launch allow you to create clips with anime, black and white or vector art styles. Lastly, with Keyframe Cropping you can upload the first and final frame of a video and select an aspect ratio. Firefly will then generate a video that stays within your desired format.</p>\n<p>In June, Adobe added <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobes-firefly-generative-ai-app-is-now-available-on-mobile-130055044.html\"><ins>support for additional third-party models</ins></a>, and this month it&#39;s doing the same. Most notable is the inclusion of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-veo-3-ai-model-can-generate-videos-with-sound-174541183.html\"><ins>Veo 3</ins></a>, which Google premiered at its <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-io-2025-recap-ai-updates-android-xr-google-beam-and-everything-else-announced-at-the-annual-keynote-175900229.html\"><ins>I/O 2025 conference</ins></a> in May. At the moment, Veo 3 is one of the only AI models that can generate video with sound. Like with all the other partner models Adobe offers in Firefly, Google has agreed not to use data from Adobe users for training future models. Every image and video people create through Firefly is digitally signed with the model that was used to create it. That is one of the safeguards Adobe includes so that Firefly customers don&#39;t accidentally ship an asset that infringes on copyrighted material.</p>\n<p>According to Zeke Koch, vice president of product management for Adobe Firefly, users can expect the fast pace of updates to continue. &quot;We&#39;re relentlessly shipping stuff almost as quickly as we can,&quot; he said. Koch adds Adobe will continue to integrate more third-party models, as long as their providers agree to the company&#39;s data privacy terms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-firefly-can-now-generate-sound-effects-from-your-audio-cues-130008172.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>After several generations of iterative updates, it feels like Samsung tossed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 into a Hyperbolic Time Chamber to create a stunning device that's leaner, stronger and more powerful than before. The best part though is the phone looks and functions just like a regular handset now that there’s less bulk to lug around. But at a moment's notice, it can go Super Saiyan by opening up to reveal an even larger 8-inch display to become a true multimedia raidboss. Unfortunately, it's still extremely expensive at $2,000. Though if you can handle the price, in a lot of ways, Samsung has finally achieved foldable phone nirvana with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-design-chefs-kiss\">Design: Chef's kiss</h2> \n<p>When Samsung debuted its updated super sleek design language on the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-more-than-just-super-thin-180042172.html\">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, it felt like a novel way to reimagine the S25+ as a more engaging device. But when the company gave the same treatment to the Z Fold 7, that engineering became something truly transformative. Compared to its predecessor, Samsung's big foldable for 2025 is 10 percent lighter at just 215 grams. The bigger drop comes in thickness with Galaxy Z Fold 7 measuring a whopping 26 percent thinner (just 8.9mm when folded). This represents the biggest generation-over-generation decrease for the entire Z Fold line, which is kind of shocking considering it's happening seven years in. The result is a foldable that is basically the same size and weight as the Galaxy S25 Ultra (it's actually a little narrower), which is no mean feat for a class of gadgets that has been plagued by extra heft since they first came out.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"fa2ee245fe5e4c81aaf75987e7f3fa1b\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7K9LFCL/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>What might be just as impressive is that Samsung hasn't really cut corners to deliver the Z Fold 7's streamlined dimensions. You still get an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance (which can handle submersions of up to 5 feet for 30 minutes) along with Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 in front and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 in back. Samsung also completely re-engineered its Armor FlexHinge, which glides open and closed like a dream. Samsung even says that Z Fold 7's ultra-thin glass is 50 percent thicker than before while also sporting a new titanium lattice that adds additional support and durability to the phone's flexible display.</p> \n<p>Inside, Samsung has switched away from the under-display sensor used on previous models in favor of a more traditional hole-punch camera. This is a bit of a shame as it adds a small blemish to that otherwise gorgeous screen. However, with the panel now measuring 8 inches across (up from 7.6 on the Z Fold 6), there's more of it to enjoy even after you account for the small cutout. Plus, the move to a higher-res 10-megapixel sensor for this camera results in significantly better image quality than any of Samsung's under-display modules.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/7aa954b0-6287-11f0-83dd-7c7349c0e35d\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/7aa954b0-6287-11f0-83dd-7c7349c0e35d\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's cover screen is slightly larger than the previous model's at 6.5 inches while also being noticeably wider. \" data-uuid=\"189b359b-ca11-35ad-aedd-e9cad0938622\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The one small design quirk is that sometimes the phone doesn't unfold all the way, often stopping just short at 179 degrees — much like the original <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-fold-review-the-challenger-that-samsung-needs-specs-price-170003458.html\">Pixel Fold</a>. That said, you can always make it go fully flat with a bit of extra pressure, though most of the time I don't even bother because this is the kind of thing that you don't really notice unless you're specifically looking for it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-displays-now-even-bigger-both-inside-and-out\">Displays: Now even bigger, both inside and out</h2> \n<p>As for brightness and image quality, Samsung's panels are still unmatched. In addition to a larger main display, the Z Fold 7's exterior Cover Screen is slightly bigger at 6.5 inches. More importantly, it's noticeably wider too while sporting even thinner bezels, which makes the whole phone feel more usable. The feeling of holding a skinny baton I got on previous models is completely gone. Both screens also support a 120Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of 2,600 nits. And when compared to rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Fold 7's displays just pop a touch more thanks to slightly richer colors and saturation.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a0957ea0-630a-11f0-bffa-7d47b0fe293f\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/a0957ea0-630a-11f0-bffa-7d47b0fe293f\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's main display is even larger now at eight inches across, though its hole-punch interior camera is more of an eyesore compared to the under-display sensors used in previous models. \" data-uuid=\"b269baf3-c914-387f-a609-b349ffa726c8\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>After introducing S Pen integration on the Z Fold 3, Samsung has removed stylus support for this model — a big downgrade that may anger longtime Z Fold fans. The company claims it made this decision after seeing \"very low\" S Pen usage on previous generations, which frankly isn't all that surprising. But, as one of the highlight features that separated Samsung's big foldables from practically all of its rivals, it's still sad to see it go.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-performance-and-software-the-fastest-big-foldable-phone\">Performance and software: The fastest big foldable phone</h2> \n<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 unquestionably packs top-tier performance. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip along with 12GB or 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Everything feels fast and snappy while OneUI 8 and Android 16 bring app optimizations that help make the most of the phone's big display.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/e09f2b00-6287-11f0-bffa-c54a1f04f1ef\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/e09f2b00-6287-11f0-bffa-c54a1f04f1ef\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"When closed, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures just 8.9mm thick, a decreased of 26 percent compared to its predecessor. \" data-uuid=\"fd803092-e33a-3304-9f8a-e92951a288f2\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The biggest eye-opener for me was when I compared how long it took the Z Fold 7 to launch my current favorite mobile game, <em>Sword of Convallaria</em>, against the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Even with the increased performance of Google's recent Tensor chips, Samsung's foldable loaded the game in 13 seconds compared to 18 seconds for the Pixel. That might not sound like a ton, but it’s around 25 percent faster and when it's something you do multiple times a day, shaving off even a few seconds adds up fast..</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras-a-major-resolution-bump\">Cameras: A major resolution bump</h2> \n<p>While the Z Fold 7's ultrawide and 3x telephoto cameras are largely unchanged, the phone features a big photo upgrade thanks to a new 200MP sensor for its main camera. This is essentially the same component Samsung used in the S25 Ultra and S25 Edge, and it delivers a much-needed bump in image quality.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/0dbd9d10-6288-11f0-8c8f-3be1ba8edbb4\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/0dbd9d10-6288-11f0-8c8f-3be1ba8edbb4\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"The biggest upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's photography is a new 200MP sensor for its primary camera. \" data-uuid=\"189e0aac-8231-3b5c-bbdc-66017fc5c6ab\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>In bright light, the Z Fold 7 easily keeps pace with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. In certain situations like when snapping pics of food, some may prefer its shots thanks to Samsung's warmer color profile. The phone still tends to oversharpen things, but colors are vibrant. For those who want to maximize resolution, you can select the phone's full 200MP mode (images are captured at 12MP by default). At night, the Fold 7's shots remained surprisingly sharp. I still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro Fold due to its more accurate white balance and often sharper focus, though Samsung's phone isn't far behind.</p> <core-slideshow data-slideshowid=\"321ef214-f754-4a4e-a31c-70e6f79217bc\" /> \n<p>Potentially the biggest shortcoming on the Fold 7 is that its 3x optical zoom can't quite match the 5x telephoto cam on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But for fans of group shots, Samsung added a new selfie camera with a wider 100-degree field of view.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-life-and-charging-solid-longevity-but-still-only-qi-2-ready\">Battery life and charging: Solid longevity, but still only Qi 2 ready</h2> \n<p>While the Z Fold 7's 4,400mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, you will get slightly increased longevity due to improved power efficiency from its processor. In our local video rundown test, the Z Fold 7 lasted 20 hours and 50 minutes when using its main 8-inch display and 26 hours and 22 minutes with its exterior screen. Depending on which display you use, that's between 45 minutes and an hour longer than what we got from the previous model, which is nice to see considering battery life was already pretty solid.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/5af11a30-6288-11f0-9b7f-af705aafa3c6\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/5af11a30-6288-11f0-9b7f-af705aafa3c6\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's battery has the same 4,400mAh capacity as the previous model, though overall longevity has increased slightly thanks to a more power efficient processor. \" data-uuid=\"59cea472-cea2-3507-912d-225054336666\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Sadly, Samsung hasn't changed much when it comes to recharging. The Z Fold 7 supports wired charging at up to 25 watts — which is rather average for a modern flagship — alongside 15 watt wireless charging. And like the rest of the 2025 premium Galaxy line, this phone is merely Qi 2 ready, which means there's no built-in attachment system for magnetic accessories like charging pucks, card holders and battery packs. So if you want to use peripherals like those, you'll need to get a case with full support for Qi 2.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2> \n<p>I've always said that Samsung is at its best when it focuses on hardware design, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be one of the best examples of that. With its latest flagship foldable, Samsung has removed one of the remaining barriers preventing people from trying out the new breed of phones: excessive size and weight.</p> \n<p>By widening its cover display, the Z Fold 7 looks and acts just like a regular smartphone, which is great for checking messages, looking up directions or snapping a photo. When you want to get really immersed in a show, movie or game, you can open up that beautiful flexible display, which is now even larger for your viewing pleasure. The phone’s higher-res main camera also brings upgraded image quality while its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip gives it a performance edge over rivals like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/32055550-6288-11f0-9ef3-b3e2c123295a\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/32055550-6288-11f0-9ef3-b3e2c123295a\" style=\"height:2000px;width:3333px;\" alt=\"As before, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 still offers an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance. \" data-uuid=\"2eae7d1e-08e2-345d-b505-a99ccba839bf\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>I don't love how Samsung is backtracking on features by removing S Pen support and reverting to an old-school camera cutout instead of an under-display sensor for its main display. But at least in the case of the latter, that change comes with much improved image quality, which is a big upgrade for video calls.</p> \n<p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, you really do get the best of both worlds. Its new design is just as sleek as comparable traditional flagships while hiding a larger display that makes the need for small tablets obsolete. Unfortunately, with a starting price of $2,000, Samsung hasn't addressed the last roadblock stopping people from trying out a device that might completely change the way they use their phone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-foldable-phone-nirvana-for-a-price-123004636.html?src=rss",

In addition to standard emoji, the game also uses Genmoji, which are custom emoji created using Apple Intelligence. For each round of the game, players will have to complete three phrases. They can reveal the clues baked into the phrases if they want, but it will use up one of their moves, which are limited in number.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>News+ subscribers will be able to play the game in the Puzzles section of the Apple News app. Later this year, they&#39;ll be able to play it in the upcoming dedicated <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-unveils-a-dedicated-games-app-at-wwdc-2025-174028901.html\">Apple Games app</a>, as well.

Some devices, like the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html\">Meta Quest 3</a>, are entirely standalone, which means you don't need anything but the headset itself to use it. Other VR headsets need to be connected to a system from which it can draw power and run software. Some systems, like the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hp-reverb-g2-review-vr-windows-mixed-reality-130012057.html\">HP Reverb G2</a>, must connect to a PC, while others like the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html\">PS VR2</a> can connect to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html\">gaming consoles</a> like the PS5.

Consult with Shigeru Miyamoto.</p>\n<p>\"We'd built up a lot of expertise in gameplay development for 3D action games through our work on 3D Mario games, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,\" producer Kenta Motokura said. \"But we needed to dive deeper into the fundamental question of 'What is Donkey Kong?' So, our first step was to seek out Miyamoto-san and Nintendo Executive Officer Yoshiaki Koizumi.\"</p>\n<p>In their talk, Miyamoto emphasized DK's moves like hand slaps and blowing. Along similar lines, Koizumi pointed to the ape's massive arms, which he uses to punch and hoist heavy objects. That got the team thinking. After all, who doesn't want to control a giant ape who runs around, breaking shit?</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/c1c51c80-627d-11f0-9fcf-7e7e62c0419c\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/c1c51c80-627d-11f0-9fcf-7e7e62c0419c\" style=\"height:635px;width:1129px;\" alt=\"Donkey Kong Country Returns gameplay still.

First, the 2017 title included some light environmental destruction. (Think the cheese rocks in the Luncheon Kingdom and Bowser's smashing in the final level.)</p>\n<p>The team experimented with fully destructible environments soon after <em>Odyssey</em>'s release. (That was long before they knew they'd make a Donkey Kong game.) That included the adorably strange idea of putting smashing fists on a Goomba and setting it loose. <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/\">Part two</a> of the interview includes a short video of one of these tests.</p>\n<p>On a technical level, the key to that mechanic is using voxels (3D pixels). \"In <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, we started using voxels midway through development, so the areas where we could apply them were limited,\" Motukura said. \"But the trial and error we went through back then directly led to what we were able to do in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Another interesting tidbit from the interview is that they started working on the game as a Switch 1 title. \"We originally began developing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges,\" Motokura said. \"I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.\" In the comparison image below, you can see a much richer environment in the Switch 2 version.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/8323d3d0-627e-11f0-bf6b-784c97f2af3a\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/8323d3d0-627e-11f0-bf6b-784c97f2af3a\" style=\"height:675px;width:1200px;\" alt=\"A side-by-side view of Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch and Switch 2.

Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything.\"</p>\n<p>There are many more nuggets in Nintendo's interview. This includes animal transformations and Pauline's role in the game. (She must be the forgiving type, given how they started.)

    "summary": "<p>Mac owners will soon be able to play one of the biggest games of the last five years or so. <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em> will be available in the Mac App Store as well as Steam, GOG.com and the Epic Games Store on Thursday, July 17. As the name implies, it includes both the base game as well as the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion from 2023. The port was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-will-be-available-for-macs-early-next-year-164520024.html\">announced last fall</a> and was originally planned to arrive \"early\" this year, but it took a little longer to get everything squared away.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, you'll need an M-series Mac to play this game, but Apple and CD Projekt Red confirm that it'll work on computers all the way back to the M1 — but you'll need 16GB of RAM. For years, 8GB was the standard on entry-level Macs, so those computers will be out of luck. And of course, graphics fidelity will vary widely across the various supported chipsets, but CD Projekt Red is including a \"for this Mac\" graphics preset that is optimized for each Apple Silicon-based Mac. So at the very least, you shouldn't have to fuss around with settings too much to get a decent experience.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Shortly after the initial announcement, CD Projekt Red <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2894/for-this-mac-preset\">provided more details</a> on the \"for this Mac\" setting as well as recommended specs. While the game does work with an M1 Mac, you're capped at 30fps and a low resolution — things escalate rapidly from there. The recommended configuration calls for an M3 Pro chip with 18GB of RAM to hit 60fps at 1080p. That configuration supports Ray Tracing, but regardless of what you're using <a data-i13n=\"elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1\" class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2897/ray-tracing-on-mac\">you'll need to turn it on manually</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/4546ec60-625a-11f0-affa-2afdd5b0c310\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/4546ec60-625a-11f0-affa-2afdd5b0c310\" style=\"height:2160px;width:3840px;\" alt=\"Cyberpunk 2077 Mac system requirements\" data-uuid=\"53b135e9-7bac-3b08-8d64-6df8a2197c6b\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">CD Projekt Red</div></figure>\n<p>Things go up from there, with 36GB of RAM and either an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip to run high fidelity; very high fidelity requires an M3 Ultra or M4 Max. That essentially means you have a $2,000 or up Mac Studio or a $3,200 and up MacBook Pro with the M4 Max if you want to run this game at the highest of settings. Of course, if you care about such things, you probably already have a good gaming PC.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for other technical goodies, the game utilizes AMD FSR for upscaling and frame generation, and Apple's MetalFX also provides upscaling as well. Upcoming Metal 4 features announced at WWDC 2025, including Metal FX Frame Interpolation and Metal FX Denoising, are coming to the game via a future update. Metal FX Frame Interpolation generates an intermediate frame for every two input frames and can be combined with existing Metal upscaling to allow the game to hit 120fps on Ultra settings — but again, we're not sure what specific models will support that.</p>\n<p>If you use AirPods with your Mac, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> features spatial audio with head-tracking features. And the game supports cross-progression regardless of what platform you play on, which should be useful for anyone who started a game elsewhere and wants to pick it back up on a Mac. If you've already purchased <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> from another storefront like Steam, it'll automatically be available for Mac.</p>\n<p>While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> isn't exactly a new game, it remains one of the more popular and lauded titles of the decade (at least after CD Projekt Red fixed numerous launch bugs). And it joins a still small but growing number of major games optimized for Apple Silicon and the Mac, including the recently-released <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows.</em> A quick look on the Mac App Store also shows AAA releases including <em>Death Stranding, Control, Lies of P, </em>numerous Resident Evil titles as well as smaller but no less awesome games like <em>Neva </em>and <em>Stray. </em>Most big-name games don't come to the Mac at the same time as other platforms still, but the Mac is an option for more than just Apple Arcade games.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 16, 2025, 11:44AM ET:</strong> This story has been updated with more details from the developer on the different specs required to hit the varying performance tiers in <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-comes-to-the-mac-on-july-17-130047453.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>If I had to describe the status of <em>Subnautica 2</em> in just three words, it would be these: messy, messy, messy. That’s not to say the game itself is in terrible shape — this is actually a pivotal claim in the whole situation — but the relationship between Subnautica series developer Unknown Worlds and its parent company, Krafton, is in shreds. This month alone, Krafton fired the founders and CEO of Unknown Worlds, <em>Subnautica 2</em> was delayed until 2026 and the ousted leaders filed a lawsuit against Krafton, looking to regain creative control of the game and the studio. At the center of the conflict is a bonus payment worth up to $250 million.</p>\n<p>Here’s a rundown of how we got here and what in the devil is going on with <em>Subnautica 2</em>, Krafton and Unknown Worlds.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/6f478ca0-641b-11f0-9f7e-501f08960720\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/6f478ca0-641b-11f0-9f7e-501f08960720\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Subnautica 2\" data-uuid=\"acba4a67-742b-3312-8c3c-69d5285e6b9a\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Krafton</div></figure>\n<p>Charlie Cleveland accidentally started Unknown Worlds in 2001 while building the popular <em>Half-Life</em> mods <em>Natural Selection</em> and <em>Natural Selection 2</em>, and technical director Max McGuire came on as an official studio co-founder in 2006. Inspired by <em>Minecraft</em> and burned out on mods, Unknown Worlds began working on the undersea, open-world exploration game <em>Subnautica</em> and released it in early access on Steam in 2014. With years of community feedback, the game evolved into a singularly tense and rich survival experience, and version 1.0 officially landed in 2018. This is also when Ted Gill joined the studio’s executive team, freeing up Cleveland to focus on creative direction. <em>Subnautica</em> and its spin-off, <em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em>, attracted millions of players and established Unknown Worlds as a successful independent team.</p>\n<p>So, the larger studios came sniffing. <em>PUBG</em> publisher Krafton, which operates with billions of dollars annually, purchased Unknown Worlds in 2021 for $500 million. The acquisition came with the promise of an additional payout worth up to $250 million if Unknown Worlds hit certain performance goals by the end of 2025. This bonus is a critical piece of the chaos today.</p>\n<p>We know more about the details of this deal thanks to recent reporting by <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders\"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>. In addition to the leadership positions, which were filled by Cleveland, Gill and McGuire, Unknown Worlds had about 40 employees at the time of the Krafton sale, and they received payouts totaling $50 million at closing and over the following two years. This larger group was poised to receive as much as $25 million in the 2025 performance-based earnout, with each person expecting a different amount, but most estimating six or seven figures. The remaining $225 million was reserved for the Unknown Worlds leadership, but they said they intended to share a portion of their windfall with employees who weren’t included in the bonus, covering the full studio headcount of about 100 people.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/cb38d780-641b-11f0-bfe3-3a1ed8b31978\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/cb38d780-641b-11f0-bfe3-3a1ed8b31978\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Subnautica 2\" data-uuid=\"2e6168ea-827b-3a70-82ed-748f47a74f55\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Krafton</div></figure>\n<p>The leadership of Unknown Worlds repeated this promise in a lawsuit filed against Krafton on July 10, 2025. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>\n<p>After the acquisition, Unknown Worlds continued updating <em>Subnautica</em> and <em>Below Zero</em>. In February 2024, the studio released <em>Moonbreaker</em>, a turn-based strategy game that never really took off, partially because of its <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/moonbreaker-completely-removes-microtransactions-monetization\"><ins>initial microtransaction system</ins></a>. Since then, the studio has been focused on <em>Subnautica 2</em>. The game was <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subnautica-2-hits-early-access-in-2025-with-four-player-co-op-194227017.html\"><ins>officially announced in October 2024</ins></a> with a prospective early access launch window of 2025. It’s currently the second-most wishlisted game on Steam, after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>\n<p>The first public notion that something was rotten between Unknown Worlds and Krafton came on July 2, when Cleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and replaced by former <em>Callisto Protocol</em> studio head Steve Papoutsis. Krafton didn’t provide a reason for the switch-up <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/\"><ins>in its press release</ins></a>, instead offering the following nearly complete thought: “While Krafton sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.”</p>\n<p>Krafton didn’t mention delaying the early access launch at this time, but it implemented a review process that it said would be “essential to delivering the right game at the right time.” The publisher suggested the ousted leaders had been uncooperative in this aspect.</p>\n<p>“Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations,” its press release said.</p>\n<p>Cleveland published <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.charliecleveland.com/what-is-a-wave-but-a-thousand-drops/\"><ins>a blog post</ins></a> on July 4 reflecting on his time in game development, and sharing his disappointment at Krafton’s handling of Unknown Worlds and <em>Subnautica 2</em>. He also referenced Krafton’s intent to delay the launch.</p>\n<p>“You can see why for Max, Ted, myself, the Unknown Worlds team, and for our community, the events of this week have been quite a shock,” Cleveland wrote. “We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it. And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.”</p>\n<p>On July 9, Krafton officially <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026\"><ins>delayed the early access launch</ins></a> of <em>Subnautica 2</em> to 2026. That same day, <em>Bloomberg</em> published a report outlining the performance-based bonus agreement and implicitly questioning how the timing of the delay would make it difficult for the studio to hit its goals, putting the payout in jeopardy. This was the first time the details of the bonus became public.</p>\n<p>Krafton <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subnautica-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-2026-amid-developer-drama-123042406.html\"><ins>shared a statement</ins></a> with Engadget — and in a pop-up on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://krafton.com/en/\"><ins>its own homepage</ins></a> — on July 10 that straight-up accused the fired leaders of abandoning the studio in favor of personal creative pursuits, specifically calling out Cleveland’s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.abyssal.co/\"><ins>film production company</ins></a>. It also threw shade at <em>Moonbreaker</em> and claimed the former bosses wanted the bonus payment “for themselves.”</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/39d6dd90-641c-11f0-becf-b91b3b7fe479\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/39d6dd90-641c-11f0-becf-b91b3b7fe479\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Subnautica 2\" data-uuid=\"3b40525b-a35e-3467-a631-7f79d65a7043\"><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Krafton</div></figure>\n<p>“Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so,” the statement said. “In particular, following the failure of <em>Moonbreaker</em>, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project. Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.”</p>\n<p>That same day, Cleveland announced that he and the other ousted studio heads had <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/subnautica-studio-co-founder-says-hes-suing-parent-company-krafton-153412484.html\"><ins>filed a lawsuit</ins></a> against Krafton.</p>\n<p>“Suing a multibillion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list,” Cleveland wrote. “But this needs to be made right. Subnautica has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it. As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue.”</p>\n<p>The lawsuit wasn’t unsealed until July 16. But on July 15, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders\"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> reported that Krafton now planned to extend the window for the bonus payment by an additional year, giving the studio more time to hit its goals. The publisher will also reportedly advance a portion of a separate profit-sharing bonus pool to all Unknown Worlds employees in 2025.</p>\n<p>These moves seem designed to moot the core issues raised in the breach of contract complaint that Cleveland and other Unknown Worlds leaders filed against Krafton in Delaware Chancery Court. The lawsuit, <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Scribd;elmt:;cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cc8a75f0-b695-4a6a-a33c-41019f4bfaa4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=67cb1b8b-cb1c-4a6a-9dcc-a9feb5e08106&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Scribd&amp;linkText=unsealed+on+July+16&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50Lzg4OTE3MTM4MC9vcnRpcy1BZHZpc29ycy12LUtyYWZ0b24tVmVyaWZpZWQtQ29tcGxhaW50LVJlZGFjdGVkLXBvc3RlZC1ieS1HYW1lLUZpbGUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjY3Y2IxYjhiLWNiMWMtNGE2YS05ZGNjLWE5ZmViNWUwODEwNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NyaWJkLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudC84ODkxNzEzODAvb3J0aXMtQWR2aXNvcnMtdi1LcmFmdG9uLVZlcmlmaWVkLUNvbXBsYWludC1SZWRhY3RlZC1wb3N0ZWQtYnktR2FtZS1GaWxlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAVmZZiIIynBnk3QWQD8OPwb_5xnWRvKbMpcbC9D3EDju&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F889171380%2Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-Verified-Complaint-Redacted-posted-by-Game-File\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/889171380/ortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-Verified-Complaint-Redacted-posted-by-Game-File\">unsealed on July 16</a>, claims Krafton illegally fired the studio heads and delayed <em>Subnautica 2</em> in order to avoid the bonus payments. It also provides a timeline of growing tensions between the founders and Krafton this year, accusing the publisher of intentional sabotage.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit claims that Krafton and Unknown Worlds had a respectful relationship until April 2025, when Gill presented Krafton executives with the studio’s positive revenue projections, which were made with the assumption that <em>Subnautica 2</em> would hit early access in 2025. He also outlined the expected bonus payout under the agreement.</p>\n<p>“When that happened, everything changed,” the lawsuit reads.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that at this point, Krafton began looking for ways to force out the leaders of Unknown Worlds and delay the launch of <em>Subnautica 2</em>, with a goal of circumventing the bonus payment. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire argued back and forth with Krafton executives over whether the game was ready for early access, and Krafton eventually pulled all of its resources from the studio. Krafton issued a stop order on <em>Subnautica 2</em> development, took over Unknown Worlds’ communications channels and in June it started laying an internal paper trail accusing the founders of abandoning their fiduciary duties, according to the complaint.</p>\n<p>Cleveland, Gill and McGuire were fired and removed from the Unknown Worlds board of directors on July 1. This is where the rest of us entered the story.</p>\n<div id=\"68cb989dd4404c4fb1c7c27b387b20cb\"><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK5Nr1VtJ9Q?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p>The main conflict here is over whether <em>Subnautica 2</em> is really ready for an early access launch, and that matters because of a potential $250 million bonus payment that’s jeopardized by a delay. Not only is this a large sum for Krafton to lose, but it’s also a massive amount of money for Cleveland, Gill and McGuire to miss out on, especially now that they’ve lost their studio and tentpole IP. The ousted leaders reiterated in their lawsuit that they “planned to share even more of the earnout with their dedicated team” than they were contractually obligated to. In the complaint, they’re looking for Krafton to pay out the full bonus as projected without a delay, fulfill its obligations as a publisher and reinstate them as the heads of Unknown Worlds.</p>\n<p>Every party in this situation claims they want what’s best for <em>Subnautica 2</em> and its players. It’s possible that they’re all telling the truth and this is a simple disagreement over artistic integrity. It’s also possible that they’re all lying and everyone is looking to make (or keep) a quick buck — but man, that’s bleak. The truth, as usual, likely lies somewhere in between and, chances are, we’ll never know it. At least the court system will eventually be able to determine the second-best thing, which is who’s at fault.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Have a tip for Jessica?

The company's co-CEO Ted Sarandos said that generative AI was specifically used for a VFX shot in the post-apocalyptic drama, but the move is one of several ways Netflix is embracing AI.</p>\n<p>According to Sarandos, the creators of <em>The Eternaut</em> wanted to include a shot of building collapsing in Buenos Aires, and rather than contract a studio of visual effects artists to create the footage, Netflix used generative AI to create it. \"Using AI powered tools, they were able to achieve an amazing result with remarkable speed,\" Sarandos shared during the earnings call. \"In fact, that VFX sequence was completed 10 times faster than it could have been completed with... traditional VFX tools and workflows.\"</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The shot \"just wouldn't have been feasible for a show on that budget,\" Sarandos says, as someone with some input on the show's budget. The executive says that <em>The Eternaut </em>features \"the very first Gen AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film.\" Clearly, the show is also a prototype for how Netflix can avoid costs it doesn't want to swallow in the future.</p>\n<p>Workers in the entertainment industry have not taken kindly to the use of generative AI.

You get access through apps on your phone, tablet, smart TV or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:19;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-streaming-devices-media-players-123021395.html\">streaming device</a> and the signal arrives over the internet. A faster and more stable connection tends to give you a better experience. Most live TV apps require you to sign up and pay via a web browser. After that, you can activate the app on all of your devices.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-monthly-price\"><strong>Monthly Price</strong></h3> \n<p>When I started testing these cord-cutting alternatives, I was struck by the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:20;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-streaming-service-deals-133028980.html\">price difference</a> between live TV and a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:21;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html\">standard video streaming app</a>. Where the latter cost between $5 and $20 per month, most live TV services hit the $80 mark and can go higher than $200 with additional perks, channel packages and premium extras. The higher starting price is mostly due to the cost of providing multiple networks — particularly sports and local stations. And, in the past year or so, every service except Sling has raised base plan prices.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-local-channels\"><strong>Local channels</strong></h3> \n<p>Only two of the services I tried don’t include full local channel coverage for subscribers and one of those makes no effort to carry sports at all. That would be Philo and, as you might guess, it’s the cheapest. The next most affordable option, Sling, only carries three local stations — and only in larger markets — but it still manages to include some of the top sports channels.</p> \n<p>When you sign up with any provider that handles local TV, you’ll enter your zip code, ensuring you get your area’s broadcast affiliates for ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC. Of course, you can also get those stations for free. Nearly all modern television sets support a radio frequency (RF) connection, also known as the coaxial port, which means if you buy an <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:22;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D9NZTGLF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=HD+antenna&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAYFrBzybV7JrmQ6EI0-2SiNJpVRVKi5fSnmf_a2Xkzyj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAntenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels%2Fdp%2FB0D9NZTGLF\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.amazon.com/Antenna-Outdoor-Reception-Supports-Channels/dp/B0D9NZTGLF\">HD antenna</a>, you’ll receive locally broadcast stations like ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX and NBC. And since the signal is digital, reception is much improved over the staticky rabbit-ears era.</p> \n<p>But local channel access is another area where traditional streaming services, like Netflix, are bleeding into broadcast territory. For example, you can watch your local NBC station with a Peacock subscription and you can tune into your area’s CBS station through your Paramount+ subscription. Netflix is even getting into the mix with a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-signs-deal-to-host-live-tv-channels-in-france-153852590.html\">recently announced deal</a> with one of France’s broadcast companies, TF1. The streaming service will now air TF1's live TV channels and on-demand content inside the Netflix app. No word if the concept will expand to other regions, but it’s an interesting move to anyone interested in the future of streaming.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-live-sports-coverage\"><strong>Live sports coverage</strong></h3> \n<p>One reality that spun my head was the sheer number and iterations of sports networks in existence. Trying to figure out which network will carry the match-up you want to see can be tricky. I found that Google makes it a little easier for sports fans by listing out <a data-i13n=\"cpos:24;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=upcoming+nfl+games\">upcoming games</a> (just swap in NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL and so on in the search bar). When you click an event, the “TV &amp; streaming” button will tell you which network is covering it.</p> \n<p>That just leaves figuring out if your chosen service carries the RSNs (regional sports networks) you want. Unfortunately, even with add-ons and extra packages, some providers simply don’t have certain channels in their lineups. It would take a lawyer to understand the ins and outs of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:25;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/disney-cuts-directv-customers-access-to-abc-espn-and-more-123047594.html\">streaming rights negotiations</a>, and networks leave and return to live TV carriers all the time. That said, most major sporting events in the US are covered by ESPN, Fox Sports, TNT, USA and local affiliates.</p> \n<p>I should also point out that traditional streaming services have started adding live sports to their lineups. <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Peacock TV;elmt:;cpos:26;pos:1\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cbef8901-c2f3-4af7-b1b7-e2c3afcffd7a&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=50eb34db-c0fc-4bfb-ab41-1cbe97faffd8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Peacock+TV&amp;linkText=Peacock&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNTBlYjM0ZGItYzBmYy00YmZiLWFiNDEtMWNiZTk3ZmFmZmQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWFjb2NrdHYuY29tLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAYnRVh_g_jgVhSp7LBrtJVkcMpZ3bn_n25jQbBiVS3P6&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/\">Peacock</a> carries <a data-i13n=\"cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacock-ui-update-183247828.html\">live</a> Premier League matches, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-nfl-wild-card-game-broke-streaming-records-103503762.html\">Sunday Night Football</a> games and aired the 2024 <a data-i13n=\"cpos:29;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/peacocks-2024-paris-olympics-coverage-includes-enhanced-multiview-options-190047120.html\">Olympic Games</a> from Paris. <a data-i13n=\"cpos:30;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-x-ray-replays-thursday-night-football-173723667.html\">Thursday Night Football</a> as well as <a data-i13n=\"cpos:31;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nba-tv-rights-go-to-espn-nbc-and-amazon-as-tnt-is-rejected-230811550.html\">NBA and WNBA games</a> are on Amazon Prime and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:32;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/netflix-will-stream-its-first-nfl-games-on-christmas-day-163407396.html\">Christmas Day Football</a> aired on Netflix.

Of course, most live TV streaming options will deliver more sizable lists of cable networks, but just note that you may already be paying for some of them — and if all you need is a certain channel, you could get it cheaper by subscribing directly.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-on-demand-streaming\"><strong>On-demand streaming</strong></h3> \n<p>Most live TV subscriptions include access to a selection of video-on-demand (VOD) content, like you would get with a traditional streaming service. Much of this content is made up of the movies and TV series that have recently aired on your subscribed networks. This typically doesn’t cover live events and news programming, but I was able to watch specific episodes of ongoing shows like Top Chef or BET’s Diarra from Detroit. Just search the on-demand library for the program, pick an episode and hit play.</p> \n<p>Partnerships, like Hulu’s relationship with Disney, and add-ons, such as bundling Max with your YouTube TV subscription or Starz with your Sling plan, will let you watch even larger libraries of on-demand content. But again, if VOD is all you’re after, paying for those networks directly instead of through a live TV plan will be far cheaper.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-digital-video-recordings-dvr-limits\"><strong>Digital video recordings (DVR) limits</strong></h3> \n<p>Every option I tried offers some cloud DVR storage without needing a separate physical device. You’ll either get unlimited storage for recordings that expires after nine months or a year, or you’ll get a set number of hours (between 50 and 1,000) that you can keep indefinitely. Typically, all you need to do is designate what ongoing TV series you want to record and the DVR component will do all the hard work of saving subsequent episodes for you to watch later. You can do the same thing with sports events.</p> \n<p>Aside from being able to watch whenever it’s most convenient, you can also fast-forward through commercials in recorded content. In contrast, you can’t skip them on live TV or VOD.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-simultaneous-streams-and-profiles-per-account\"><strong>Simultaneous streams and profiles per account</strong></h3> \n<p>Each plan gives you a certain number of simultaneous streams, aka how many screens can play content at the same time. And while most providers will let you travel with your subscription, there are usually location restrictions that require you to sign in from your home IP address periodically. Stream allowances range from one at a time to unlimited screens (or as many as your ISP’s bandwidth can handle). Some plans require add-ons to get more screens.</p> \n<p>Most services also let you set up a few profiles so I was able to give different people in my family the ability to build their own watch histories and libraries, set their favorite channels and get individual recommendations.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-picture-in-picture-mode-and-multiview\"><strong>Picture-in-picture mode and multiview</strong></h3> \n<p>Picture-in-picture (PiP) usually refers to shrinking a video window on a mobile device or computer browser so you can watch it while using other apps. Sling, YouTube TV, FuboTV, Philo, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV all have PiP modes on computers and mobile devices. Another feature, multiview, lets you view multiple live sports games at once on your TV screen. YouTube TV and FuboTV are the only live TV streamers that let you do this. With YouTube TV, you can select up to four views from a few preset selection of streams. FuboTV offers the same feature, but only if you're using an Apple TV or Roku streaming device.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-4k-live-streams\"><strong>4K live streams</strong></h3> \n<p>Right now, just FuboTV, YouTube TV and DirecTV Stream offer 4K live streams — but with caveats. YouTube TV requires a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:48;pos:1\" href=\"https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/10383365?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\">$20-per-month add-on</a>, after which you’ll only be able to watch certain live content in 4K.

From there, you can add packages, which are usually groups of live TV channels bundled by themes like news, sports, entertainment or international content. Premium VOD extras like Max, AMC+ and Starz are also available. Add-ons cost an extra $5 to $20 each per month and simply show up in the guide where you find the rest of your live TV.

For the paid plans, just six services dominate so I tried them all. There are considerably more free live TV contenders so I tested the four most popular. After getting accounts set up using my laptop, I downloaded the apps on a Samsung smart TV running the latest version of Tizen OS. I counted the local stations and regional sports coverage, and noted how many of the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:61;pos:1\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/\">top cable networks</a> were available. I then weighed the prices, base packages and available add-ons.</p> \n<p>I then looked at how the programming was organized in each app’s UI and judged how easy everything was to navigate, from the top navigation to the settings. To test the search function, I searched for the same few TV shows on BET, Food Network, HGTV and Comedy Central, since all six providers carry those channels. I noted how helpful the searches were and how quickly they got me to season 6, episode 13 of <em>Home Town</em>.</p> \n<p>I used DVR to record entire series and single movies and watched VOD shows, making sure to test the pause and scan functions. On each service with sports, I searched for the same four upcoming NHL, NBA, MLS and NCAA basketball matches and used the record option to save the games and play them back a day or two later. Finally, I noted any extra perks or irritating quirks.</p> \n<p><strong>All live TV streaming services we’ve tested:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a

id=\"jump-link-live-tv-streaming-faqs\">Live TV Streaming FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-live-streaming\"><strong>What is live streaming?</strong></h3> \n<p>Streaming simply refers to video content that is delivered to your screen over the internet. <em>Live</em> streaming can be split into two categories: linear programming and simultaneous transmission. That first one is similar to what you get with cable or broadcast TV, with channels that play a constant flow of movies and shows (sort of what TV looked like before Netflix). Simultaneous streaming lets you watch live events (like a basketball game) or a program (like the evening news) as they happen.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-difference-between-streaming-and-live-streaming\"><strong>What is the difference between streaming and live streaming?</strong></h3> \n<p>Standard streaming, the most popular example being Netflix, lets you pick what you want to watch from a menu of choices. It’s also referred to as “video on demand.” Live streaming refers to sports and news events that you can stream as they happen in real time. It also refers to channels that show a continuous, linear flow of programming.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-streaming-service-is-best-for-live-tv\"><strong>What streaming service is best for live TV?</strong></h3> \n<p>FuboTV does the best job of letting you organize live channels to help you find just what you want to watch. The interface is uncluttered and when you search for something, the UI clearly tells you whether something is live now or on-demand. YouTube TV also does a good job making that info clear. Both have just over 100 live channels on offer.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-most-cost-effective-tv-streaming-service\"><strong>What is the most cost effective TV streaming service?</strong></h3> \n<p>Free TV streaming services like PlutoTV, Plex, Tubi and FreeVee show plenty of ad-supported TV shows and movies without charging you anything. Of course, they won’t have the same channels or content that more premium subscriptions have. Ultimately it depends on what you want to watch and finding the service that can supply that to you in the most streamlined form so you’re not paying for stuff you don’t need.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-it-cheaper-to-have-cable-or-streaming\"><strong>Is it cheaper to have cable or streaming?</strong></h3> \n<p>A basic cable package used to be more expensive than the base-level live TV streaming service. But now that nearly all major providers have raised their prices to over $75 per month, that’s no longer the case. And with add-ons and other premiums, you can easily pay over $200 a month for either cable or a live TV streaming service.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-streaming-service-has-all-the-tv-channels\"><strong>What streaming service has all the TV channels?</strong></h3> \n<p>No service that we tested had every available channel. Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream carry the the highest number of the top rated channels, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:74;pos:1\" href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/most-watched-channels-2024-tv-network-ratings-1236259845/\">according to Neilsen</a>. Hulu’s service also gets you Disney+ fare, which you can’t get elsewhere. FuboTV has the most sports channels and YouTube TV gives you the widest selection of add-ons.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-most-popular-live-tv-streaming-platform\"><strong>What is the most popular live TV streaming platform?</strong></h3> \n<p>YouTube TV has the most paying customers. According to 2024's <a data-i13n=\"cpos:75;pos:1\" href=\"https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-letter-from-neal/\">letter</a> from the CEO, the service has over eight million subscribers. Disney’s 2024 third quarter <a data-i13n=\"cpos:76;pos:1\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/11/disney-earnings-inside-out-2-deadpool-wolverine-disney-hulu-streaming-theme-parks-1236176347/\">earnings</a> put the Hulu + Live TV viewer count at 4.6 million. Sling’s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:77;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sling-tv-slips-below-2-135658433.html\">customer count dipped</a> from two million to about 1.9 million in 2024 and FuboTV grew its subscriber list to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:78;pos:1\" href=\"https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2024/Fubo-Closed-Q3-2024-With-21-Year-over-Year-Revenue-Growth-and-1.613M-Subscribers-in-North-America/default.aspx\">1.6 million</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-safe-are-free-streaming-services-and-websites\"><strong>How safe are free streaming services and websites?</strong></h3> \n<p>You may have heard certain sites that provide free content can be dangerous, leading to stolen info and/or exposing you to malware. That’s likely in reference to certain peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and file-sharing sites that let people download free movies and series — which can come bundled with malicious code.</p> \n<p>But if you’re talking about the free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services listed here, from providers like PlutoTV, Tubi and Freevee, they are just as safe as any other streaming service. Since you sometimes don’t even have to provide your email address or credit card info, they can even be more anonymous than apps that require login credentials.</p> \n<p><a href=\"#jump-link-table-of-contents\">Back to top</a></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\"><strong>Recent updates</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>January 31, 2025</strong>: Added information about which streaming service would live-stream the Super Bowl, including Tubi’s free option. Updated Fubo’s pricing. Added details about DirectTV Stream’s sports-only package and Comcast’s sports and news bundle.</p> \n<p><strong>January 16, 2025</strong>: Included higher prices for Sling’s Orange and Blue plans. Noted the demise of the never-launched Venu sports streaming service and mentioned the inclusion of DirecTV’s new sports package.</p> \n<p><strong>December 31, 2024</strong>: Noted increased pricing for YouTube TV, Hulu+ Live TV and DirecTV. Updated information for 4K streaming capabilities and requirements for multiple services. Reported on the upcoming shut down of Amazon’s Freevee service and the addition of DirecTV’s free service.</p> \n<p><strong>August 6, 2024</strong>: Updated with the addition of Plex as a free live TV streaming recommendation and mentioned the additional free channels Philo is now including with the free version of its service. Added pricing information for ESPN's new sports-only streaming service, Venu.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>June 12, 2024</strong>: Updated with more information about 4K live streaming, picture-in-picture and multiview modes, as well as video on-demand options. We expanded our recommendations around free live TV streaming services and added a FAQ query about the safety of free streaming services and clarified the difference between standard and live streaming. More traditional streaming services have added live and sports components, so we revised that section accordingly.</p> \n<p><a href=\"#jump-link-table-of-contents\">Back to top</a></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-live-tv-streaming-service-133000410.html?src=rss",

I’ll continue to evaluate the watch over the next few weeks or so and return for a final assessment. In the meantime, there’s a lot to say about the experience so far.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Samsung packed a lot of updates into its latest smartwatch, in terms of both hardware and software. But I put extra effort into testing one feature in particular — and it’s one of the more interesting.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-antioxidant-tests-and-my-persimmon-intake\">Antioxidant tests and my persimmon intake</h2> \n<p>The Galaxy Watch 8 has the same processor and sensors as the previous generation, but it’s using those to detect a new metric: antioxidant levels. You have to take the watch off and hold your thumb on the sensor node for five seconds to get a reading and you’ll need to refer to the Health app in your phone for detailed results. The first time I tested, I got a score of 60, which falls right in the middle of the “low” segment of the scale. The only other results are “very low” and “adequate,” which will surely be a disappointment to the over-achievers out there.</p> \n<p>The Health app suggested I “try eating one (100g) persimmon today.” When my grandmother was alive, she made persimmon cookies every Christmas and the last time she did so was also the last time I thought about that fruit. Considering South Korea is one of the world’s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-persimmons-industry-report-2023-092800471.html\">largest persimmon producers</a>, it might make sense that a Samsung device suggested them. The produce guy at my local grocery store said they only carry them around the holidays (no doubt because grandmas insist, plus that’s when they’re in season).</p> \n<p>Turns out persimmons are high in antioxidants such as Vitamin C and beta-carotine (Vitamin A). Cantaloupe also has those nutrients — plus it’s orange like persimmons — so I bought one. In fact, I went hard on the antioxidants and did everything I could to see if I could get a better score. I ate a bunch of cherries and a little dark chocolate. For breakfast, I had half a cantaloupe instead of the very tasty-smelling breakfast hash my husband made, and I drank plain green tea instead of my usual oat matcha latte. I did yoga and went to my monthly medical massage appointment (stress is said to increase oxidant levels). I got eight hours of sleep and drank my weight in water. I felt ready.</p> \n<p>So I took the test again and my antioxidant levels were… two points lower. Sigh. I wasn’t expecting overnight transformation, but I’d hoped for a little improvement. Next time, I’m eating the hash.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-finally-a-new-design\">Finally, a new design!</h2> \n<p>Since its <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149-120026069.html\">fourth generation</a>, the Galaxy Watch has looked pretty much the same: a round glass screen set in a round metal case with large prongs popping out of the top and bottom to hold the band. While there was nothing <em>wrong</em> with sticking with a good design, giving a device a refreshed look lends the yearly update cycle some meaning — instead of feeling like an obligatory move to appease stockholders.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14eee990-635f-11f0-b3bb-54a76f7e9da0\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14eee990-635f-11f0-b3bb-54a76f7e9da0\" style=\"height:1408px;width:2500px;\" alt=\"Galaxy Watch 8 in bright sun\" data-uuid=\"39a0f98a-9fee-3f46-b13f-d430284c396f\">\n <figcaption>\n  With 3,000 nits of peak brightness, the watch is easy to read even in the bright Albuquerque sun. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>This time around, the Galaxy Watch 8 looks markedly different thanks to a shape borrowed from last year’s <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on-didnt-fall-far-from-the-apple-tree-130030349.html\">Ultra model</a>. Samsung calls it a “cushion design” — a circular glass display set atop an aluminum case that looks like a roundish square (or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on-new-look-new-ai-and-new-antioxidants-140039472.html#:~:text=in%20an%20aluminum-,squircle,-(squarish%20circle%20or\">squircle</a> as our own Cherlynn Low calls it). The Sport band on my review model curves to meet the width of the case, creating a smooth arch that I think is more refined than the clunkier pronged configuration. In fact, the entire look is classy — much more so than the Apple Watch, which looks like a miniaturized iPhone 11 glued to a silicone strap.</p> \n<p>The cushion design is great in one way, but also worrisome. Because the glass display stands proud of the case by at least two millimeters, my first thought was: “I’m going to trash this screen.” Immediately after taking the watch out of the box, I ordered screen shields and, during the short course of this review, managed to crack one. That’s possibly because I was cheap and ordered off-brand screen protectors, or perhaps the protruding glass cushion is simply begging for misfortune.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"acef61d4440a4f8ca2334c5fe277f2c3\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-40mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l320ndadxaa/\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>However, the raised glass solves one complaint I had with the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-incrementally-better-than-its-predecessoragain-133038627.html\">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. One way to scroll is by running your finger along the outer edge of the screen. In fact, on-screen cues suggest that gesture when there’s more content to view. On the Watch 7, my finger was always getting in the way of the text I wanted to read. Now that the display is elevated, there’s room for my finger to travel further out along the outer edge and stay out of the way.</p> \n<p>Appearance aside, my favorite hardware update is how much more comfortable the watch is. The Watch 7’s underside had a sizable sensor node, and it took me a week to get used to the feel. Even then, I hated sleeping with it. The Watch 8, however, felt good the first time I put it on.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-gemini-on-your-wrist-and-wear-os-6\">Gemini on your wrist and Wear OS 6</h2> \n<p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to ship with Google’s Wear OS 6, though Samsung overlays it with its own One UI interface. The headline feature for the new software is Gemini integration. Now, most things you can do with the Gemini app on your phone can be done through your watch. Just note that you’ll need to have your Gemini-compatible phone nearby to use it.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14f8fbb0-635f-11f0-bdff-f7fa62600c39\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14f8fbb0-635f-11f0-bdff-f7fa62600c39\" style=\"height:2329px;width:4141px;\" alt=\"Galaxy Watch 8 with the Ask Gemini screen active\" data-uuid=\"00a00a65-0b83-3cd4-98f6-8ffd31c9781b\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>Google’s AI was pretty snappy at basic tasks like setting reminders and timers. Requests that required more “thought” took only marginally longer (and completed more quickly when I was using my home Wi-Fi versus relying on cell signals out in the world). I asked for the best record stores in my city and a good place to eat lunch. I was pleasantly surprised to hear of a new-to-me answer for each category. The record store turned out to be two bins of LPs inside a book shop, but still, I hadn’t heard of it before. I asked why my eight-year-old talked about lava chicken all the time and was correctly informed about Jack Black and <em>A</em> <em>Minecraft Movie</em>.</p> \n<p>The assistant displays answers in text form on the watch screen and also reads out every word. That can turn into a lot of talking, but tapping the screen stops the chatter if you prefer to read. Gemini can handle follow-up questions and tasks, but since it doesn’t usually keep listening after it speaks, you have to tap the mic icon to make your next request.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I reached out to Samsung to ask if I could change a setting to make Gemini keep listening, but there isn't one at this time. For now, you'll need to tap or say \"OK Google\" again for followups like, “Add that to my Google Keep” or “Remind me about that.” If Gemini asks you a question, however, such as verifying a text it’s about to send, it does keep listening for the answer. You can also combine commands at the outset, such as asking to look up an address and text it to someone.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I requested some fairly specific tasks and didn’t hit any snags. I asked it to text the address of a local restaurant to my husband and it verified which location I wanted then sent the message. I asked when the Albuquerque Isotopes were playing the Sacramento River Cats and it gave me the upcoming dates. I tapped the mic and said, “add that to my calendar,” which it did.</p> \n<p>It only let me down twice. When I asked whether it was going to rain, it just read me the general weather forecast instead of answering the question. All the other assistants in my life (Alexa and Siri) can answer those questions — though technically that’s a Gemini problem, not the watch's fault.</p> \n<p>The other disappointment is a matter of proper integration. I was out on a walk and I asked for directions to a nearby grocery store. Gemini told me the address and the distance, but pointed me to look at my phone for the actual directions. When I asked Siri the same thing on the same walk, directions simply showed up on my Apple Watch. (Yes, I’ve been wearing two watches and carrying around two activated phones like a double agent, just much less cool.)</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14dd3650-635f-11f0-9fbe-64c1e18823c4\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14dd3650-635f-11f0-9fbe-64c1e18823c4\" style=\"height:1406px;width:2500px;\" alt=\"Health tiles on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic display the Energy score and activity metrics \" data-uuid=\"8ffce035-213c-3168-bc93-7d1fa50ae128\">\n <figcaption>\n  Tiles on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>In addition to Gemini, Wear OS 6 introduces updated and larger tiles which organize and display information on your watch. By default, the tiles are separated into categories: Health, Fitness and Basic (weather, media playback, calendar) with each box displaying a bit of pertinent info — activity metrics, current temp, your next event and so on. If the limited info isn’t enough, tapping a tile opens the respective app. You can categorize, rearrange, swap out and add as many pages of these cards as you want in the Wear app on your phone. I didn’t have time to get the defaults tweaked exactly how I wanted, but it already feels like a much smarter way of interacting with a watch. Now you can glean key information from the apps that are important to you just by browsing your tiles.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-running-coach-believes-in-you\">The running coach believes in you</h2> \n<p>The Galaxy Watch 8 now comes with built-in, AI-fueled running guidance. This sounds a bit like the upcoming Workout Buddy that Apple announced for <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-everything-apple-announced-for-its-wearable-at-wwdc-2025-174915653.html\">watchOS 26</a>, so it will be interesting to compare the two. Google Pixel watches and Fitbits currently have the option of an AI-powered running coach, but it’s limited to Premium subscribers. Garmin offers an adaptive training program called Run Coach as well, so this isn’t an entirely novel idea.</p> \n<p>Samsung’s running coach begins with an assessment: Run as fast as you can maintain for twelve minutes. You’ll then be awarded a performance level ranging from one to ten. Each level comes with a tailored, four-week plan with four workouts per week intended to get you ready to complete a 5K, 10K, half or full marathon. My 12-minute, 22-second per-mile pace put me at a level three. My plan was geared towards getting me to run a 5K at the end of four weeks.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/04366990-63e9-11f0-93fd-2362eeee8079\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/04366990-63e9-11f0-93fd-2362eeee8079\" style=\"height:1440px;width:2560px;\" alt=\"Samsung's Runn\" data-uuid=\"355c15d2-41da-355a-9f1f-ff37b9564340\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Samsung/Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The first workout was low-intensity interval running with four segments of running hard, interspersed with cool-down walks. As I ran, the AI coach told me when and what to expect on the next segment and what my goals were for each. It spouted occasional words of encouragement and let me know when my pace started to lag. The guidance wasn’t intrusive and I appreciated the preview of and expectations for the next segment. I tried it relying just on the watch's speakers, and I could hear OK as long as the streets were quiet, but I definitely recommend using earbuds.</p> \n<p>I found myself running faster than I would have without a “coach” and now I’m honestly wondering whether I, a person my athlete sister describes as “not an athlete,” could actually complete a 5K. Maybe there’s some value in this concept after all. In any case, I find myself looking forward to taking it further. My next workout is a straight up, 30-minute jog. I’ve never continuously run for a half an hour in my life, so we’ll see how that goes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-vascular-load-bedtime-reminders-and-battery-life\">Vascular load, bedtime reminders and battery life</h2> \n<p>The quick turnaround on this article means I didn’t get to properly test some of the new features. Vascular load takes readings while you sleep to evaluate the health of your circulatory system, then tells you when your load is higher or lower than normal and offers recommendations. It requires three nights of data to set a baseline, but after the third night of wearing the watch to bed, it said I still needed one more.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Three nights of sleep should also trigger a Bedtime Guidance feature, but I didn't see an notification letting me know the guidance had begun. After asking Samsung why, I was told I needed to turn it on in the Health app (Health &gt; Sleep &gt; tap three dots icon &gt; Bedtime guidance). So I'll report back on the experience after using it for a few days.</p> \n<p>One of the prior model’s shortcomings was battery life. The always-on display (AOD) tanked the charge, so I kept it off. The Galaxy Watch 8 has a bigger 325mAh battery, compared to the 300mAh one on the Watch 7. Twenty-five milliamp hours isn’t a huge jump, but bigger is always better. Because I was testing every possible feature (sleeping, running, workouts, antioxidants, Gemini and more), I was constantly dropping the watch on the charger for partial refills in between tests. That meant I didn’t have the opportunity to methodically test the battery’s runtime just yet.</p> \n<p>I did note what I could. The first day of testing, the battery was at 100 percent at 4PM. The next day at 4PM it still had 17 percent remaining. That 24-hour period included driving directions, three workouts, lots of Gemini requests, watch face changes and a full night of sleep. I’d toggled the AOD on and off throughout that time, but the results were still better than what I tracked on the Watch 7.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-is-super-swank\">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is super swank</h2> \n<p>I didn’t have a ton of time to spend with the Classic version of the Watch 8, but it’s obviously aimed at the luxury watch-hound crowd. The knurled spinning bezel, inset diving bezel replica and the default chronograph watch face gives off serious Rolex Daytona/Omega Speedmaster wannabe vibes. It ships with a stitched leather-look band and the steel case has the heft and stature of an automatic mechanical timepiece. The always-on display and chunky buttons only add to the effect.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14e52590-635f-11f0-bfbb-027b507f921d\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/14e52590-635f-11f0-bfbb-027b507f921d\" style=\"height:1908px;width:3391px;\" alt=\"The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic looks a lot like a high-end time piece\" data-uuid=\"f98f9ea9-448e-352d-8110-ce42845ebd09\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>For me, the main advantage it has over the standard Galaxy Watch 8 is the protection the spinning bezel offers the raised display. The glass is shielded at the edges and it’s even inset slightly which will ward off scratches. It’s a bit chonky for my taste, but it’s surprisingly comfortable for its size and is extremely attractive. I could see this appealing to style enthusiasts who want a smartwatch but don’t want to look like they’re wearing a wrist gadget.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-pricing-and-the-competition\">Pricing and the competition</h2> \n<p>Samsung added $50 to the price tag on the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8, bringing it to $350. The larger 44mm model is now $380 (versus $330 last year) and the Classic variant is $500 for the single 46mm size. For reference, there was no Galaxy Watch 7 Classic and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic sold for $400 for the 43mm size and $430 for the 47mm.</p> \n<p>At $350, the base model Galaxy Watch 8 costs the same as Google’s Pixel Watch 3 (though the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-next-made-by-google-event-better-known-as-the-pixel-launch-is-set-for-august-20-162832319.html\">Pixel Watch 4 is almost certainly on the way</a> and could be more expensive.) The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, but it went <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-apple-watch-series-10-is-still-on-sale-for-a-record-low-price-151308930.html\">as low as $279</a> during Prime Day. And, of course, a new Apple wearable is likely coming this September with a potential price bump as well. So Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 could end up being the most affordable of the major smartwatch releases once the dust settles from 2025’s launches. And if you’re a Samsung smartphone user, it’s easily your best bet.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/8a1da0e0-63ea-11f0-bfda-64584f15141e\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/8a1da0e0-63ea-11f0-bfda-64584f15141e\" style=\"height:1441px;width:2560px;\" alt=\"The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and standard models side by side\" data-uuid=\"78d5b766-4e9f-301e-a4c0-b027c2044df5\">\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-everything-else-and-an-eventual-score\">Everything else and an eventual score</h2> \n<p>The core functions of the Galaxy Watch 8 haven’t changed all that much.

So I’ll just point out that the workout tracking is still accurate — and it’s faster to suss out when I’m on a walk than my Apple Watch. The companion Health app, where you view all the data your watch gathers, is helpful and a delight to use with its common-sense suggestions and friendly animations. And the daily Energy Score is a useful indicator of how I’m doing with my sleep and movement goals.</p> \n<p>The Watch 8 covers the basics well, acting as an industrious accessory for a Galaxy phone. Although, as with the Watch 7, I wish the notifications were more intrusive as they’re easy to miss. The double tap feature is great — a pinch gesture that dismisses or triggers actions without you having to touch the screen. I use it often and the watch almost always registers the motion. And finally, I love how customizable the watch faces are. When you combine all that with a substantially refreshed look, some capable Gemini integration, a few new health features and a more navigable interface, Samsung’s latest wearable becomes a very capable wrist companion. I still need to live with it a while longer (with a new screen protector firmly in place) to assign a review score, but so far, I’m impressed.</p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-my-first-days-with-samsungs-smartwatch-have-been-promising-155857718.html?src=rss",

Working with Google Deepmind and director Darren Aronofsky's studio Primordial Soup, McNitt used a combination of live-action footage and AI-generated media to tell the story of her own traumatic birth.</p>\n<p>The result is an uncanny dramatic short where the genuine emotion of the live-action performance wrestles agains the artificiality of AI imagery. The film begins when the lead's (Audrey Corsa, playing McNitt's mother) routine natal care appointment turns into an emergency delivery. From that point on we hear her opine on how her child and all living things in the universe are connected — evoking the poetic nature of Terrence Malick's films. We jump between Corsa's performance, AI footage and macro- and micro-photography. In the end, Corsa holds a baby that was inserted by Google's AI, using prompts that make it look like McNitt as an infant.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"2e3432264b6a478495f077de196e5a76\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HEs9miwtwh4?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>There's no escaping the looming shadow of Google's AI ambitions.

In the case of <em>Ancestra</em>, she wanted to use AI to accomplish difficult work, like creating a computer generated infant that looked like her, based on photos taken by her father. She found that to be more ethical than bringing in a real newborn, and the results more convincing than a doll or something animated by a CG artist.</p>\n<p>\"I felt the use of AI was really important for this story, and I think it's up to every artist to decide how they wanna use these tools and define that,\" she said. \"That was something else for me in this project where I had to define a really strong boundary where I did not want actors to be AI actors, [they] had to be humans with a soul. I do not feel that an performance can be recreated by a machine. I do deeply and strongly believe that  humanity can only be captured through human beings. And so I do think it's really important to have humans at the center of the stories.\"</p>\n<p>To that end, McNitt also worked with dozens of artists create the sound, imagery and AI media in <em>Ancestra</em>. There's a worry that AI video tools will let anyone plug in a few prompts and build projects out of low-effort footage, but McNitt says she closely collaborated with a team of DeepMind engineers who crafted prompts and sifted through the results to find the footage she was looking for. (We ran out of time before I could ask her about the environmental concerns from using generative AI, but at this point we know it <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117\">requires a significant amount of electricity and water</a>.

Because ultimately, These are human stories for other human beings. And so it's, you know, important that we are at the center of that.\"</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/engadget-podcast-ancestra-director-eliza-mcnitt-defends-ai-as-a-creative-tool-150042942.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "<p>文｜胡香赟</p>\n  <p>编辑｜海若镜</p>\n  <p>“直到上周五开董事会时，礼新医药BD的两款药物都在正常推进研发，跨国药企很重视。”7月17日的并购说明会上，中国生物制药（01177.HK，下称“中生制药”）董事会主席谢其润回应了市场对礼新医药的产品可能被退货的传闻。</p>\n  <p>就在3天前，中生制药宣布，以9.5亿美元对价（约合68亿人民币）100%收购本土创新药公司礼新医药。收购完成后，礼新医药团队将集体加入中国生物制药，并“给予相应激励”。</p>\n  <p>礼新医药是时下的明星创新药公司，2019年创立以来，基本保持着一年融一轮的速度，背后不光有泰格医药、启明创投、清松资本、上海生物医药基金等投资方，还拥有总价超40亿美元的BD交易，光是和阿斯利康、默沙东的BD首付款及近期里程碑就有10亿美元之多。</p>\n  <p>这样的创新药资产，中生制药为何能不到10亿美元的价格拿下？外界一时间浮想联翩，传言默沙东可能要“退货”，礼新医药的管线价值其实不高。</p>\n  <p>直到17日的说明会上，买卖双方的一把手同时站出来否认称，这是项“意愿强烈、双向奔赴”的交易，从谈判到完成只用了2个月。谢其润还表示，从尽调结果来看，对收到默沙东的第二笔款项“非常有信心，就将在近期发生”。</p>\n  <h2><strong>高性价比，拿下创新药黑马</strong></h2>\n  <p>说明会上，谢其润笑称自己与礼新医药创始人秦莹在去年时相识，两人是朋友、战友，每次见面都能“畅聊梦想”。</p>\n  <p>也正是这一年底，中生制药和礼新医药披露了首次合作：作为后者C1轮融资的领投方，中生制药以1.42亿人民币拿下礼新医药4.91%的股权，并就其核心的靶向CCR8单抗等多个管线达成合作。</p>\n  <p>那时，并购的话题就以开玩笑的形式被多次提起。到了今年，创新药市场回温，双方也在有了一定合作基础之后，开始正式推进并购。</p>\n  <p>从结果上来看，这场并购堪称高性价比，买方称：“所有利益方都很满意”。</p>\n  <p>站在中国生物的角度，尽管对价是9.5亿美元，但剔除掉礼新医药账上的4.5亿美元现金及等价物，交易净价只要5亿美元。而且在中生制药的计算中，这还要再减去总计3亿多的交割前运营支出和默沙东的第一笔里程碑付款，相当于中生制药最多只花费2亿美元，就完全控股了礼新医药。</p>\n  <p>对于礼新医药背后的投资机构来说，通过并购实现退出，也是不错的选择。按照去年10月的C1轮融计算，礼新医药当时的估值约为29亿人民币，如今仅过去不到10月就以68亿人民币价格卖出，最新一轮投资机构的回报率也会超过100%。早期以更低估值进入的老股东，收益可能更高。</p>\n  <p>那么，卖方礼新医药亏了吗？也并非如此。</p>\n  <p>此前，礼新医药是一家颇为低调的创新药企业，很少对外发声。秦莹曾师从上海瑞金医院内科血液研究所的王振义院士，进入产业界后先后任职于葛兰素史克、赛胜医药等企业，从业经验近30年。</p>\n  <p>目前，礼新医药主要从事大分子创新药研发，ADC和双抗技术平台均已搭建成熟，与阿斯利康、默沙东的BD交易就是最好的验证：2023年，礼新医药以5500万美元近期付款、5.45亿美元总价将抗GPRC5D ADC药物LM-305授权给阿斯利康；2024年11月，公司又以8.88亿美元首付款及技术转移里程碑、24亿美元总价把PD-1/VEGF双抗LM-299卖给了默沙东。</p>\n  <p>截至目前，礼新医药也是唯一同时就ADC和PD-1/VEGF双抗两类热门产品与跨国药企达成BD合作的中国创新药企。</p>\n  <p>但硬币的另一面，和所有本土创新药企一样，随着产品管线陆续推进，临床开发能力是绕不过的门槛。<strong>成立5年多来，礼新医药团队至今也只有58人，临床团队占比约一半，但已有8个自研创新药管线进入临床。</strong></p>\n  <p>其中，光是核心的CCR8单抗LM-108和CLDN18.2靶点的ADC药物LM-302就同时开了8个临床，不仅包括两个大3期，大部分还都是联合用药。而且，两个产品预期都要在未来2-3年内推上市。</p>\n  <p class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-img-size-val=\"1119,602\" src=\"https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250718/v2_d92ba6e902b9487596651f829933e52f@5930287_oswg455481oswg1119oswg602_img_png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_100/format,jpg/interlace,1\"></p>\n  <p class=\"img-desc\">礼新医药临床阶段管线开发进展</p>\n  <p>推进这样量级的临床试验，需要巨额资金和充足人力，行业内处于此阶段的创新药上市公司，动辄融资数十亿人民币。也就是说，凭借礼新医药现有的人员规模和资金储备，再独自做下去，压力十分沉重。</p>\n  <p>秦莹也坦言，礼新医药能有今天的速度，很大程度上依赖于CRO。另外，从一开始，公司就没打算独立做商业化，所以一直在寻找潜在的合作方。</p>\n  <p>但在当前的行情下，虽然并购路径经常被提起，但中国创新药企的大并购时代还远远没有到来。找跨国药企买方，意味着巨大的整合成本和团队磨合过程；看向本土企业，能“一次性掏出2亿美元以上资金做Biotech并购”，且具备强大临床、商业化实力的综合性企业少之又少。</p>\n  <p>换言之，哪怕是像礼新医药这样的创新药“黑马”，当下的选择权也并不多。</p>\n  <p>“加入中生制药不是突然的决定，经过深度考察后，这是最好的选择。”秦莹表示。</p>\n  <h2><strong>中生制药的创新布局将走向何方？</strong></h2>\n  <p>中生制药背后的是实控方是泰国著名华商谢氏家族，外界对其最熟知的动作大概是2020年底入股新冠疫苗厂商科兴中维。如今，在谢其润、谢承润姐弟两位“谢氏家族”第四代的执掌下，中生制药这家老牌传统药企也在慢慢推进自己的“创新转型”进程。</p>\n  <p>今年6月，中生制药曾公告表示，创新产品的收入占比已从2018年的16%提高至2024年的42%，到2025年和2027年，这一数字将分别增至50%和60%。且未来3年，将按照“自研+BD”的路径，每年上市5款创新产品。此外，中生制药2024年的研发投入达54.9亿元，其中创新药研发投入占比接近80%。</p>\n  <p>从具体方式来看，一方面，中生制药在逐步剥离传统业务，如通过出售商业流通和仿制药板块子公司部分股权的形式，累计已获得超20亿元的收益；另一面，则是通过BD、并购加速创新产品的研发。</p>\n  <p>如果从中生制药现有的产品布局上来看，据2024年年报，公司在肿瘤领域拥有36个候选药物处于临床及以上开发阶段，其中进入上市申请的有3个，处在3期/注册临床阶段的有8个；技术布局上，相较于小分子，公司在大分子药物上的优势更为明显。</p>\n  <p class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-img-size-val=\"1169,652\" src=\"https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250718/v2_b76b0fff1e894851a7d7b4aa6cdb328d@5930287_oswg475153oswg1169oswg652_img_png?x-oss-process=image/quality,q_100/format,jpg/interlace,1\"></p>\n  <p class=\"img-desc\">中国生物制药技术平台示意</p>\n  <p>礼新医药的技术平台和产品并入后，无疑将进一步加强中生制药在这一领域的研发实力。按照当前进展，最受期待的就是收购前就达成合作的CCR8单抗LM-108。</p>\n  <p>这是一种表达于肿瘤浸润调节性T细胞表面的趋化因子受体，目前，全球布局该靶点的企业虽也有数十家之多，如BMS、艾伯维、百济神州等国内外企业均有布局，但还没有产品获批，已经披露数据的更是少数。全球范围内，LM-108的进展都处在前列，已取得2项突破性治疗品种认定，预计在2028年上市。</p>\n  <p>秦莹在介绍其临床数据时提到，在实体瘤、胃癌、胰腺癌的治疗中，LM-108都展现出了优于标准治疗效果的潜力。以晚期实体瘤为例，LM-108联合PD-1治疗后的中位无进展生存期达8.1个月，而标准治疗仅为3个月。</p>\n  <p>除了已进入临床的产品之外，双方也将加速针对更早期阶段产品的研发。中生制药方面称，礼新医药的管线将成为公司“未来重要的早期研发资产”，预计未来1-2年内将有多个项目进入临床。</p>\n  <p>“今年，中生制药的市值已经翻倍。希望在礼新医药的加持下，尽快重返巅峰，即刻起飞。”谢其润表示。</p>",

    "summary": "<p>2025年来，mRNA领域颇有“复苏”的迹象。6月底，艾伯维宣布斥资21亿美元收购体内CAR-T疗法公司Capstan Therapeutics；而BioNTech、Moderna等更早入局的企业，也已布局了成熟的mRNA疫苗的药物设计和递送技术等研发平台，探索肿瘤疫苗等产品的研发，进展快者已进入二期临床阶段。</p>\n  <p>相较之下，国内企业在该领域的布局虽整体比较早期，但也逐渐有“玩家”跑出。近期，云顶新耀就系统展示了基于公司自研的mRNA创新技术平台开发的3款产品，分别为通用型现货肿瘤治疗性疫苗（TAA）EVM14、个性化肿瘤治疗性疫苗（PCV）EVM16，以及自体生成CAR-T项目。</p>\n  <p>从技术根基来看，云顶新耀的mRNA平台整合了自研AI算法与LNP（脂质纳米颗粒）递送系统两大核心能力。在抗原序列设计上，公司已完成三代AI算法升级。第一代聚焦密码子优化与生产风险控制，第二代实现密码子与RNA二级结构协同优化，第三代则整合UTR（非翻译区）与CDS（编码序列）联合优化，大幅提升靶蛋白表达水平。</p>\n  <p>递送系统方面，云顶新耀搭建的 LNP平台在可电离脂质和隐形脂质领域均有专利布局，超500种专有脂质库可满足疫苗及自体生成CAR-T等多类项目需求，可覆盖肿瘤、自免、代谢性疾病等多个领域。</p>\n  <p>从管线进展上来看，EVM14近期已完成“中美双报”，其全球多中心I期临床试验（EVM14 C101）预期在今年三季度完成首例患者入组，主要针对鳞状非小细胞肺癌、头颈部鳞状细胞癌及食管鳞状细胞癌3大瘤种。</p>\n  <p>另一款个性化肿瘤治疗性疫苗EVM16已于今年3月完成首例患者给药。该临床试验初步数据显示，即使低起始剂量也能激发晚期肿瘤患者特异性T细胞反应，具有良好的免疫原性。</p>\n  <p>据首席执行官罗永庆介绍，随着相关产品研发不断推进，<strong>云顶新耀已和全球Top 20药企中的多家建立联系，并签署多项保密协议</strong>。</p>\n  <p>近两年，BD几乎成为国内创新药企的重要“KPI”。相关数据统计，<strong>今年以来，全球肿瘤领域授权交易的首付款中，来自中国的资产贡献了将近50%的份额</strong>。“这说明不同于过去，跨国药企现在已经非常认可中国创新的价值；第二，也证明了中国的自主创新、成本和效率都达到了一定程度。”</p>\n  <p>具体到mRNA技术领域，该技术集合了软件式平台、通用型生产平台的优势，具备覆盖从肿瘤到自免、代谢性疾病、传染病等多种难治性疾病的药物开发能力。作为基因技术，mRNA技术可将药物开发从“分子筛选”转变为“信息设计”，实现了“信息即药物”，可利用人体自身生成药物，使人体成为为自身生产药物的“智能工厂。</p>\n  <p>从过往的案例看，在个性化肿瘤疫苗产品领域，国际大药企之间有过很多交易，比较有代表性的是Moderna和BioNTech两家的对外合作，比如Moderna和默克（2亿美元首付款+2.5亿美元期权）、BioNTech和Genentech（3.1亿美元首付款）；自体CAR-T领域的合作则集中出现在2024年之后，比如今年，阿斯利康以10亿美元收购自体生成CAR-T公司EsoBiotech、艾伯维21亿美元收购Capstan。</p>\n  <p>从执行层面，云顶新耀方面表示，公司并不急于立刻完成一个BD，而是要做“正确的BD”。究其原因，首先，截止2024年底，云顶新耀现金储备为16亿元，未来1-2年的mRNA类产品开发不需要借助外界资本。</p>\n  <p>此外，什么时间做BD、做什么结构的BD，也需要仔细考虑。比如在时间节点上，拥有临床数据之后再授权的价值，可能就比临床前阶段要高出很多。以阿斯利康收购EsoBiotech为例，EsoBiotech使用的是慢病毒平台，目前为止只有1个病人数据，其他都是临床前，估值就有10亿美元。</p>\n  <p>相较而言，罗永庆认为，云顶新耀“现在做的是mRNA平台，有动物数据，安全性更好”。“我们有很多的选择权，全球前20位的公司很多都跟我们进行了深入的接触，所以选择权很重要。”</p>",

<p>如何将作品变成商品，成了闻献的核心命题。</p>\n  <p>孟昭然给出的答案是拥抱中国文化。在他看来，香水和奢侈品一样，最终售卖的是情感与故事，做到好闻并不难，难的是还有人能记住的故事。</p>\n  <p>而闻献需要的，是一个能覆盖所有人的统一故事：不管中国人、外国人，还是四五线渠道的用户、电商平台的买家，抑或线下高端商场的客户，都能理解。</p>\n  <p>“唯一能担起这个角色的，就是中国文化。”</p>\n  <p>老铺黄金的成功已经验证了中国文化的力量，这次，闻献也会成功吗？</p>\n  <p>在尚未抵达更深的地方前，我们和闻献主理人孟昭然聊了聊。</p>\n  <p class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-img-size-val=\"1920,2880\"

class=\"img-desc\">（闻献创始人孟昭然）</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><strong>以下是36氪与闻献创始人孟昭然对话（经编辑）：</strong></p>\n  <h2><strong>以前是作品，现在要做商品</strong></h2>\n  <p><strong>36氪：闻献这个名字还挺特别。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>最先起英文名字的时候，我们想找一个识别度和公允性比较高的词，另外团队都是设计师出身，我们一直觉得嗅觉是很好的储存记忆和表达自己的媒介，而documents也有记录、储存的意思，翻译成中文是“文献”，而“文”又与“闻”同音，这种微妙的叠义关系，正好道出了我们想做的事 —— 用香气记录情绪、经验与时间。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：高客单价的产品不只有香水可做。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>这多少和我做花艺的经历有关。当时常年与花打交道，我慢慢感受到季节的层次不只是春夏秋冬那么简单。颜色、气味、手感，一切都让人与自然的连接变得非常细腻。那时候我就在想，能不能把这种“与自然对话”的方式，变成一种更长效、更稳定的产品 —— 比如香水。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：闻献每一季的产品名字都很特别，羽化仙、空无一木……</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>但这种表达太小众、太个人、太自我，只能算好作品。但从生意体量和商品效率来看，这样一个个去做营销，处处都是门槛，成不了商品。所以，第七季，我们要做真正商品化的东西，让香气被更多人喜欢、理解、接受。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：以前没有发现这样做会形成门槛吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然</strong>：以前是有意为之，打扮得花枝招展，大家才对你好奇。</p>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：从作品到商品的转变，是什么使然？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然</strong>：心态和阶段性目标变了吧。一开始我们只想做行业内喜欢的小而美的品牌，但人会成长、会不满足—— 只被同行喜欢、关注不够，还想让更多人喜欢、购买我们的产品。这自然就需要做能破圈的商品。但这其实对我个人来说是一次非常现实的考验 —— 如何把创意变成一门好生意，不只是一个浪漫的想法。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：背后有欧莱雅推动吗？</strong></p>\n  <p>孟昭然：不算推动，但欧莱雅确实提供了很大帮助。比如他们会分享行业数据、商业信息，还有他们在国内的生意逻辑 —— 从什么维度判断生意，以及做预算的表格、公式等工具。这对我们很有用，节约了很多时间，因为我们团队最早几乎没人有美妆大厂的背景，一开始真的都是自己摸索。</p>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：转变是必须的吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>不是必须的，当然有很多品牌可以一直坚持只做“作品”。这个转变是我自己经历的过程，从2022 到 2024 年，因为经历了许多挑战和危机，慢慢磨平了心态，不再飘、不再不切实际。</p>\n  <p>过去的 “作品” 模式有很多不确定性，随着生意体量增长和自身成熟，这些不确定性会变成更大风险。而解决风险的重要方案，就是把作品变成商品 —— 作品只需要对自己负责，商品却要对企业、用户、股东负责。</p>\n  <p>这个过程可能会磨掉一些个性和棱角，但更安全、健康。对一个品牌来说，可持续发展、长远存在并持续产生影响（无论影响 1 人还是 1000 万人），首先是要健康活下去。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：转变过程痛苦吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>说不上痛苦，主要是去补全过去缺失的信息结构。比如原来不知道香水行业怎么定预算、怎么划分渠道等等，现在慢慢也学会了、习惯了。</p>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：有什么以前不能接受，现在能接受的？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>比如渠道串货这件事。我们自营渠道从不打折，连李佳琦直播间都不打，但有时候网上还是会出现一些折扣商品，最开始我会很焦虑，觉得影响品牌。但现在没那么在意了。</p>\n  <p>这几年我们渐渐认识到，中国市场足够大，每个渠道有它自己的生态系统，哪怕有串货，只要整体体系健康、有序，也不至于伤筋动骨。这是构建更全面的信息和思维视角后的变化。</p>\n  <h2>“闻献实际没有那么贵”</h2>\n  <p><strong>36氪：国际品牌的香精浓度为8%-15%，闻献选择了两倍的香精浓度,为什么一定要做浓香水？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>除了能支撑高定价，还有个原因是我和团队用香水的习惯就很“放肆”。 别人喷两次在手腕、脖子就够了，但我们可能会喷十次，以前下班后要跟同事吃饭、再去喝酒，整个过程都需要身上有香水味道，怕留香太短。 这是对年轻用户的一个重要洞察，他们需要留香久、存在感够强的香水，浓香水恰好能满足这点。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：闻献身上最亮眼的标签好像是「贵」。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>闻献有些产品定价不低，但如果按单毫升价格来说，其实并没有想象中那么贵，只是比一般商业香水贵一些而已，而我们的原料确实成本高，用料也不省。真正买过闻献的用户，大部分不会觉得我们贵。</p>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：介意闻献被说 “贵” 吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>以前特别在意，心情还会受影响。但现在不会了 —— 生意稳定，消费者在复购，团队状态也健康，心里就很踏实了。我最近把所有社交媒体账号都删了，不让自己被太多无效声音左右。</p>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：这几年用户愿意为闻献买单，你们的秘诀是什么？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>我们有自己的风格，而风格其实就是一种态度 —— 它会吸引与你频率一致的人靠近你。这种独特性是品牌在市场中站住脚的关键，我们始终在坚持这个核心。</p>\n  <h2><strong>像老铺黄金一样拥抱中国文化</strong></h2>\n  <p><strong>36氪：过去消费者因为闻献的个性买单，当品牌走向市场化时，用户还会继续买账吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>我觉得不会有太大影响。即使我们正走向市场，产品依然保持着鲜明的个性，只是在命名、定位和叙述方式上，变得更通俗、更容易理解了一些。“通俗”不等于“没个性”，只是换了一种打开方式，让更多人有机会靠近。</p>\n  <p>我们现在还是比较有信心的：一方面是有比较坚实的用户基础 —— 去年线下全渠道复购中，60%来自老用户，粘性很强；二是我们的生意整体状态健康、稳定。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：商品化、市场化的东西长什么样？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>比如我们的第七季，就是一次有意识的转向。这一季用了非常鲜明的中国风语言，不只是外包装用了各种层次的“中国红”，我们还第一次用香材本身来命名产品，叫「沉檀龙麝」。不仅香水采用了“中国焚香调”，这个系列还配套推出了盘香。</p>\n  <p>我们今年有明确的出海计划，会尝试在海外机场开店，所以在规划第七季香水时，我们就一直在想：当进入更成熟的市场，面对更专业、资深的用户，必须回答清楚一个问题——为什么要买这款中国香水？为什么要买闻献？中国文化就是我们给出的答案。</p>\n  <p class=\"image-wrapper\"><img data-img-size-val=\"1920,2400\" src=\"https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250717/v2_c15413261d9c4a35b72ba81f0ab4176e@5654145_oswg168025oswg1920oswg2400_img_000?x-oss-process=image/format,jpg/interlace,1\"></p>\n  <p class=\"img-desc\">（闻献第七季「沉檀龙麝」香水系列）</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：为什么一定是中国文化？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>今年我们不仅开启出海计划，还自己做了电商，入驻了丝芙兰。当接触的用户变得更加多元时，我们就需要一个更清晰、统一的叙述。以前那种依靠个性吸引老用户的方式，在新渠道里讲不通，也无法建立信任。</p>\n  <p>香水和奢侈品一样，最终售卖的是情感与故事，做到好闻并不难，难的是还有人能记住的故事。而我们需要的，是一个能覆盖所有人的统一故事：让不管是中国人还是外国人，不管是四五线渠道的用户、电商平台的买家，还是线下高端商场的客户，都能理解。</p>\n  <p>唯一能担起这个角色的，就是中国文化。只有它能帮助品牌击穿不同市场和渠道，把商品做成有规模的生意。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：我之前和一些香水品牌聊，他们说国外品牌不太适合中国人，因为外国人体味重，香水浓度高，所以需要开发适合我们自己人的。你们做海外市场，会做类似的反向调整吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>就像法国娇兰不会专为中国市场做香水，它始终代表自己的民族和品牌基因。我们要是迎合海外市场，肯定比不上法国品牌。我要做的就是和他们不一样。</p>\n  <p>最好的差异化，就是文化本身。这个认知，其实是我在法国读摄影时就体会到的。那时候我的作品和法国同学完全不同，我却常常拿到班级前几名，毕业时还是全校第一。老师对我说：“因为你是第一个中国学生，你拍的东西就是不一样。”那种“与生俱来”的文化视角，是任何形式模仿都无法替代的。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：欧莱雅对你们出海会有帮助吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>欧莱雅的名字本身，就是一种强大的背书，我们在海外谈合作时，一说是欧莱雅投资的首个VC项目，对方立刻就能建立起基本信任。这份信任，在陌生市场尤为重要。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：拥抱中国文化是不是也可以支撑溢价？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>中国文化当然是一种价值，但我更在意的是它是否能真正被理解、被感受到。我们产品定价偏高，确实与浓香水定位、原料成本、渠道选择等客观条件有关。还要靠消费心智层面的支撑。</p>\n  <p>作为一家年轻品牌，品牌历史积淀（heritage）是没法凭空创造的。如果只是凭借表面的设计形式、长相，很难支撑我们的设计深度，也很难支撑溢价的高度，文化才是那个真正撑得起高度的内核。</p>\n  <p>但文化的作用不是把100元的香水卖到1000元，而是让1000元的香水真正被看懂、被喜欢、被购买。它的作用是帮助作品完成商品化。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：这让我想到了老铺黄金。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：我觉得</strong>老铺的厉害之处，不在于品牌规模多大，而在于它用中国古法建立了标准，借助中国文化这个“巨人的肩膀”，提升了品牌的背景厚度和历史感。</p>\n  <p>我们2020年创品牌、2021年开业时，并未打算走中国风，品牌表达偏向国际化、当代、极简与神秘，虽然有庙宇的氛围，但并未刻意强调“东方”。前三年到去年，我们更强调个人风格与气味表达。但到了去年年底，我们意识到，脱离根源的表达容易失去持久力。于是我们做了转变。“中国香 世界礼”成为了新slogan，第七季「沉檀龙麝」则是这个新方向的集中表达。</p>\n  <p>做出这一选择，一方面是顺应趋势变化，所谓“识时务者为俊杰”；另一方面，是在创作中发现，脱离根基的架空表达难以持续——没有来源和出处的创作缺乏支撑，而自身成长的轨迹与文化土壤，才是最原创、最真实的灵感源泉，更何况我们还有如此深厚的文化资料库可供挖掘。</p>\n  <h2><strong>把生意做大</strong></h2>\n  <p><strong>36氪：今年开店是重点？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>今年的开店计划去年就定好了，国内现在开了大概二十六七家，年底会开到35家。现在我们的重点是推进电商业务，说实话，绝大多数美妆创业公司都是“线上为主”，线下只是补充。但闻献刚好相反 —— 我们的线下比例大于线上。这种结构确实存在问题，但问题的另一面也意味着机会。下一阶段，我们希望能把线上也做起来，做到线下和线上各占一半。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：记得你说过创立之初就就发力线下是闻献和其他新消费公司的不同之处。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>我们的线下布局相对扎实，门店数、坪效、选址策略都比较明晰 —— 能开多少家，几乎可以算出来。</p>\n  <p>但公司要增长，就得找到更好的增长点，机会显然是在线上。只是我们还在探索最适合自己的方式，正在通过组建团队、引进新的人才来推进。</p>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：线上的人对价格会比线下敏感。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>所以我们在线上渠道也是有策略性的调整：比如在抖音平台，我们主推的不是浓香水，而是淡香精。我们从已有的畅销香水中，筛选出几款人气口碑好、接受度高的，重新开发成淡香精，还做了15 毫升、5 毫升的小规格，在抖音卖得很好，用户也不会纠结贵不贵。</p>\n  <p>这其实就是用产品解决问题。既然消费者觉得贵，那一定是存在价格带的空缺。我们就主动去找这些有需求的用户群体，比如在抖音、天猫、快手这些平台上，为他们提供适合的产品，同时不动摇原有渠道的定位。</p>\n  <p>产品本身是分层的，就像汽车有几万十几万的入门款，也有更贵的旗舰款。一个有40万预算的人，不会去质疑30万的车贵不贵。我们同样也是按照这个逻辑在布局产品线。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：很多新品牌的香水味道和大牌相似。</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>这是行业现状。不管是国内的香精公司，还是国际香精巨头的中国团队，很多人习惯了“仿香” —— 拿大牌的配方当背书来提案。</p>\n  <p>因为中国很多化妆品品牌创始人，本身是做渠道、做销售、做贸易或是做配方出身，他们自己没有香味审美判断能力，就只能看香奈儿、迪奥有没有用过某种气味，当成判断标准。</p>\n  <p>而我们从一开始就和合作方明确 —— 必须理解闻献的创香逻辑，绝不接受仿香。谁主动提仿香，我们就不合作。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：所以你们怎么创造出popular的香水？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>我们很有信心做出畅销香水，因为已经摸透了中国消费者对气味的偏好。其实很多品牌的香水，大方向味道都差不多，就细微处有差别。市场上好卖的也就那几种风格，做好闻不难。难的是让香水有个让人记住、愿意传开的故事，靠故事带动销量。说到底，香水是一个靠“品牌力”和“渠道逻辑”共同驱动的生意。真正让人心动的，是气味背后的故事，是那种愿意被反复讲述、分享的记忆。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：你们做香氛、身体护理，也是从把生意体量做大的考虑出发吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>可以说是一种战略性拓展吧。从生意体量来看，这确实是一条成熟且被验证过的路线，很多品牌都是这么走的，比如娇兰、毛戈平，都是护肤、彩妆、香水香氛三品类齐全。</p>\n  <h2><strong>做产品的灵感是 “买” 出来的</strong></h2>\n  <p><strong>36 氪：在你看来，闻献有什么值得自豪的地方吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>闻献的生意体量没什么可自豪的，它属于中小赛道，和很多品牌比起来就是个小众品类。</p>\n  <p>但有一点我特别自豪：在海外奢侈品的强大竞争下，我们不仅能生存、能卖得出去，还有不错的复购。更关键的是，我们这种价格不低的商品，完全是从零做起，没有任何历史背景，也没有明星加持，能做到这样其实非常难，比想象中难得多。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：闻献一直很顺利吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>也走了很多弯路。现金流短缺、货品断供、生意下滑，单店业绩下跌；还有选址失误，成本特别高，关店可能比开店还贵，因为涉及赔偿、租约违约金、装修报废等。这都是我们成长中缴纳的学费。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：你喜欢什么样的品牌？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>前几年喜欢巴黎世家，做服装时确实受影响，带点它的影子。近几年喜欢 Bottega Veneta，低调又有细节，廓形版型也好，那些重复性的元素，像重复的线条、编织、堆砌，是一种极限表达。和闻献的 “禅酷” 美学系统相呼应。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：怎么理解“禅酷”？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>禅（Zen）的核心是日常练习，禅宗主张在重复日常中积累，最终顿悟。这种“悟”其实就是“酷”，一种开创性的创新思维的产生，和 “一万小时定律”等通过重复达成突破的道理相通。</p>\n  <p>36氪：你喜欢的导演、作家？</p>\n  <p>孟昭然：导演像程耳、李安。作家像双雪涛，那种原生的野性和passion，让我深受触动。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：这些人的作品会为你做产品提供灵感来源吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>我是一个很消费主义的人，最大的兴趣就是买东西。</p>\n  <p>为什么我那么喜欢消费品，并坚定做了消费品？我觉得消费品可能比小说、电影、文学、音乐更能影响大众，而我也恰好擅长这个领域。</p>\n  <p>我的灵感不是来自电影或文学艺术作品，而是 “买” 出来的。逛街时看店铺环境、体验产品本身，比如护肤品的肤感、气味、使用体验，服装的廓形版型。每次发现新品牌，或是接触更贵的东西，都能感受到其存在的道理。消费主义背后藏着丰富的文化，涉及圈层、阶层、小众群体等，这很有意思。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：如何看待中国品牌的未来？</strong></p>\n  <p>孟昭然：我相信中国品牌真正的未来，不止是“被看见”，而是被理解、被喜爱，甚至被信仰。</p>\n  <p>我们这一代人，可能是第一次在全球语境下，用自己的方式去讲“中国”这个命题 —— 不是重复古老的符号，不是照搬西方的模版，而是从自身出发，找到属于当代中国人的表达方式。</p>\n  <p>一个好品牌，它不是一种标签，而是一种生活方式的构建，是价值观的传递、是美学的启蒙。而中国品牌的意义，不止是拿出好产品，而是让这些价值在世界舞台上，被平等地对待，被认真地聆听。</p>\n  <p>我不觉得我们已经“到了”，但我愿意相信，只要我们还在不断创造、不断提问，哪怕走得慢一点，也终将抵达一个更深的地方。</p>\n  <p><strong>36氪：闻献未来有可能会被欧莱雅收购吗？</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>孟昭然：</strong>还没往这方面想，真到了需要做这个选择的时候再考虑吧。</p>",

<p>当地时间7月17日，美国白宫新闻秘书莱维特表示，近日美国总统特朗普小腿出现轻微肿胀，对特朗普腿部的超声检查显示，他患有慢性静脉功能不全。莱维特解释说，“这是一种常见病症，在70岁以上人群中尤为普遍。关键的是，检查未发现深静脉血栓或动脉疾病迹象。”莱维特还说，经检查，“没有发现心力衰竭、肾功能障碍等严重疾病的迹象”。特朗普现年79岁。他上周在纽约现场观看国际足联俱乐部世界杯决赛时，有照片显示他脚踝明显肿胀，引发外界对其健康状况的猜测。（界面新闻）</p>\n

<p>近日，“男子寄107万元油卡遭快递员变卖”登上微博热搜榜，引发关注。据九派新闻，总价值107万元的油卡被顺丰快递员变卖后，顺丰仅同意总计赔偿2500元。</p>\n  <p>此前消息称，4月24日起，扬州的梁先生通过顺丰快递先后向客户发出5个装有数百张加油卡的包裹，其中4个包裹均价值20万元，1个包裹价值27万元，总价值107万元。客户总是以“公司账户冻结”“财务休息”等理由搪塞，迟迟不能支付货款。</p>\n  <p>几乎在同一时间，梁先生发现二手销售平台上有他寄出去的油卡在销售。“售卖人提供的联系方式和负责我包裹的快递员联系方式是一样的。”梁先生由此怀疑，快递员勾结客户并在二手平台抛售套现。5月13日，梁先生以诈骗为由向当地公安报案。在这期间，梁先生向顺丰公司索赔，因为其发货时明确支付了保价费用，每个包裹约5万保额。顺丰理赔员给出的方案为，每个包裹仅赔偿500元人民币，总计赔偿2500元。日前，梁先生已通过法律途径起诉了顺丰速运有限公司，期望对方索赔在快递运输过程中造成的全部损失。据大河报，7月16日，当事人梁先生告诉记者，扬州当地警方已立案，目前涉事人员暂未被执行刑事强制措施。（界面新闻）</p>\n

The International Math Olympiad (IMO) sees countries send up to six students to solve extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems. These exercises are seemingly simple but usually require some creativity to score the highest marks on each problem. For <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2025\">this year&#39;s competition</a>, only 67 of the 630 total contestants received gold medals, or roughly 10 percent.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>AI is often tasked with tackling complex datasets and repetitive actions, but it usually falls short when it comes to solving problems that require more creativity or complex decision-making.

Wei and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, both added that the company doesn&#39;t expect to release anything with this level of math capability for several months.

Riddlebit Software&#39;s platformer-shooter hybrid, which is published by Curveball Games, is coming to Steam on September 4. It looks like it could be fun!

The world needs more funny point-and-click adventures in the vein of those classic LucasArts games. Three Headed Monkey Studios and publisher Daedalic Entertainment have made a positive first impression to suggest they&#39;re ready to take that particular baton. There&#39;s no release date or window as yet, but this was an instant addition to my wishlist on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594530/Ghost_Haunting/\">Steam</a> (let&#39;s just hope I don&#39;t forget about this one, eh?)</p>\n<div id=\"b03a027d21c747969e8f6be1adfbc329\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUMPgUcd7Sk?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\" data-embed-domain=\"www.youtube.com\"></iframe></div>\n<p>I would love to play a tour manager simulator game at some point, getting into the nitty gritty of making sure gigs and everything else involved in a band&#39;s life on the road goes smoothly. Rockbeasts is not <em>quite</em> that, but it still seems like it could be a good time.</p>\n<p>This is a &quot;grungy&quot; narrative-driven rock band management game from Lichthund and Team17. The trailer is fun and there are some interesting talents involved here. Rockbeasts was written by writer Jakub Szamałek, who was senior writer of <em>The Witcher 3</em> and principal writer of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Even cooler is that Iggy Pop voices on of the characters, who is named Iggy Pup.
