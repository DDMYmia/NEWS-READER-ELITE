(Fox News)\n\"He and every other sanctuary politician should be thanking CBP for getting this scum out of American communities instead of obstructing federal law enforcement at every possible turn,\" she continued.\nAnother migrant arrested on Thursday was Mexican national Carlos Mata, also a convicted felon, who Border Patrol says fled and broke into a nearby apartment before he assaulted the person inside as he attempted to evade arrest, prompting a 911 call for a reported break-in.\nDEMOCRATS FUME OVER NEW PLAN TO HOUSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN NEW JERSEY, INDIANA MILITARY BASES\nJavier Dimas-Alcantar and Carlos Mata were arrested in a raid at a Sacramento Home Depot.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n      \nRoyal commentator and broadcaster Neil Sean weighs in on the new interview from Prince Harry. \nKing Charles III is said to be \"cautious and wary\" about his son’s latest peace offering.\nThe claim was made by British royals expert Hilary Fordwich following reports that Prince Harry is hopeful that the Invictus Games, which are taking place in his home country in 2027, will result in a warm reunion with the royal family, particularly with the monarch. \n\"King Charles, while cautious and wary, might attend the Invictus Games,\" Fordwich told Fox News Digital. \"But of course, he prefers all private matters to remain private. In addition, there are many conflicts with the royal schedule, let alone Queen Camilla’s 80th birthday during the games.\"\nPRINCE WILLIAM'S ABSENCE AT KING CHARLES AND PRINCE HARRY'S 'PEACE SUMMIT' COULD BE A 'WARNING SHOT': EXPERT\nPrince Harry told the BBC that he would \"love reconciliation with my family.\" (Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images)\n\"For Harry, it’s about what he can gain, while, for the royals, it’s about what they have to lose,\" Fordwich claimed. \"Harry wants to be included. He misses not only the U.K. but many aspects of royal privileges. However, he hasn’t been successful in any of his endeavors. For the royals, more disclosures and scandals are concerning. They simply don’t need… Harry around, particularly not Prince William, who is resolute regarding any reconciliation being a huge mistake.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Buckingham Palace and Archewell, which handles the offices of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, for comment.\nPrince Harry will be in his home country for the Invictus Games in 2027. (Kola Sulaimon/AFP via Getty Images)\nIt’s understood that sending invites to the Invictus Games is not Harry’s responsibility, but up to the Invictus team. Still, it would be a heartfelt gesture for the king to support his younger son publicly.\nTalks of a royal reunion have been a hot topic since the recent \"peace summit\" took place.\nThe former Prince Charles and Prince Harry laugh during the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games at the Queen Elizabeth Park on Sept. 10, 2014, in London. (Luke MacGregor/WPA Pool/Getty Images)\nAccording to the Mail on Sunday, Meredith Maines, the Duke of Sussex’s chief of staff and communications director, flew from California to London recently to meet with the king’s communications secretary, Tobyn Andreae. Liam Maguire, who oversees the U.K. press for Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, was also present. \nFox News Digital learned that Maines was in London to meet with the U.K.-based communications team, media, stakeholders and senior figures connected to Harry’s patronages. It’s understood that the visit was routine and part of ongoing planning and engagement.\nWATCH: PRINCE HARRY LOOKING TO RECONCILE WITH KING CHARLES, ROYAL FAMILY \nA source told the Mail on Sunday that the meeting was only the \"first step towards reconciliation between Harry and his father, but at least it is a step in the right direction.\"\nThe Invictus Games is an international sporting event for wounded servicemen and women. (Bernard Weil/Toronto Star via Getty Images)\n\"It was always the case that the Sussexes, who rely on their royal connections for the work they receive, were going to use the Invictus Games, an important military charity, to promote the idea of ‘reconciliation,’\" royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams explained to Fox News Digital.\n\"No one can disagree with the theory of it, but the fact is that they have exploited their royal connections whilst trashing the family and making Queen Elizabeth’s last years so difficult,\" Fitzwilliams claimed.\nPrince William, King Charles III and Prince Harry watch the coffin of Queen Elizabeth during her funeral at Westminster Abbey on Sept. 19, 2022, in London. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)\n\"King Charles is in his late 70s and is battling cancer,\" he continued. \"He also would like a relationship with the grandchildren he has hardly seen. Also, as monarch, he is commander in chief of the Armed Forces. Is it difficult, therefore, for him to refuse to attend the Games for personal reasons.\"\nThe Invictus Games Birmingham will take place from July 10 to 17, 2027. Camilla's 80th birthday is July 17, 2027. (Justin Tallis - WPA Pool/Getty Images)\nHelen Helliwell, CEO of the Invictus Games in Birmingham, recently told People magazine that she also hopes members of the British royal family will be in attendance for the 2027 event.\n\"We [would] be delighted if they came over for the year out and for the Games,\" she told the outlet. \"We are so far out it’s impossible for one individual to confirm their plans, but we would be delighted if the Duke were able to come.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nPrince Harry is seen here with his father, the former Prince Charles, and his stepmother Camilla during the Invictus Games on Sept. 10, 2014, in London. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)\n\"I’ve seen the impact [of the Games],\" Helliwell shared. \"His passion is unsurpassed. He really brings a magical sparkle dust to his interactions, and there is a really special relationship with him and the community. So, we will be super excited to host him in Birmingham as well.\"\nThe Duke of Sussex attends the Closing Ceremony of the 2025 Invictus Games, at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, Canada. (Aaron Chown/PA Images via Getty Images)\nHelliwell pointed out that the royals are \"supporters of the Armed Forces.\"\n\"We're two years away, and it’s too soon to confirm who's going to be there,\" she said. \"But obviously, we'd be delighted if members of the royal family were able to attend and would very much welcome their presence in a couple of years’ time.\" \nSeveral senior royals, including Prince William, reportedly don't trust Prince Harry after he publicly aired his grievances. (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)\nStill, Fordwich pointed out that several senior royals reportedly don’t trust the Duke of Sussex, 40. Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's royal exit in 2020, the couple has publicly discussed their struggles with royal life in interviews and documentaries. \nHarry’s 2023 memoir \"Spare\" also laid bare embarrassing details about the House of Windsor and shed light on his sibling rivalry with his brother Prince William, heir to the British throne.\nThe monarch and his younger son share a warm embrace, circa 2014. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)\nThe royals never publicly commented on Harry’s tell-all. But many experts believe they’re still not over it and the damage it caused to the monarchy’s reputation.\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

(Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images)\n\"The major issue continues to be the lack of trust any of the senior royals can ever have in Harry,\" said Fordwich. \"Time after time, he has rejected his family’s values, he reveals private family matters, which is unprecedented, and, in general, has behaved in an abhorrent manner. For any family, such a betrayal would be hard to forgive, let alone having been part of such a highly sensitive environment.\"\nSeveral senior royals reportedly can't get over the publication of \"Spare.\" (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)\nFitzwilliams claimed that senior royals have been \"keeping their guard up.\"\n\"Trusting the Sussexes is out of the question,\" he claimed. \"Reconciliation is desirable… [But] it is considered unlikely that William wants any contact. Turbulent times lie ahead.\"\nPrince William is heir to the British throne. (Mikolaj Barbanell/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nIn May, Harry told the BBC that he wanted reconciliation, but that his father, 76, wouldn’t speak to him. Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner claimed to Fox News Digital that as the king continues to battle cancer, his young grandchildren would be on his mind.\nPrince William, the former Prince Charles and Prince Harry look at an Apple iPhone during the Invictus Games on Sept. 11, 2014, in London. (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)\n\"I feel King Charles would love to be involved with his American grandchildren, showing them Highgrove and Balmoral,\" he said. \"I feel this is an opportunity not to be missed. It would make the legacy of the king complete to see his whole family united… It would also be a timely reminder for those seeking to rule the monarchy that Charles, as king, is still the supreme leader and makes his own decisions.\"\n\"It is time for the king to make strong decisions that reflect the values of the oath he took to serve all people,\" Turner added.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe British royals are reportedly still worried about leaks from the Sussexes. (Christoph Reichwein/picture alliance via Getty Images)\nStill, British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital it would take a lot more than extending an olive branch to his father for Harry to win over the family.\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle during the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games Düsseldorf at Merkur Spiel-Arena on Sept. 16, 2023, in Germany. (Joshua Sammer/Getty Images)\n\"He can start by being more self-aware – throw down his sword and end the family attacks for good,\" Chard suggested. \"Showing some contrition wouldn’t go amiss either. It also doesn’t help that the Invictus Games fall on Queen Camilla’s 80th birthday… Prince Harry needs to start building bridges if he wants to redeem himself. I am dubious… as he is contradictory. He constantly feels so hard done by.\"\nPrince Harry has been living in California since 2020. (Kola Sulaimon/AFP via Getty Images)\nDuring his sit-down with the BBC, Harry admitted. \"I don’t know how much longer my father has,\" referring to his cancer diagnosis.\n\"There's no point in continuing to fight anymore,\" he said.\nFox News Digital's Christina Dugan Ramirez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\nStephanie Nolasco covers entertainment at Foxnews.com.\nGet a daily look at the top news in music, movies, television and more in the entertainment industry.\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

    "language": "en",
    "full_content": "ByDavey Winder\n\nByDavey Winder,\n Senior Contributor. \nMicrosoft SharePoint is under attack.\nUpdate, July 21, 2025: This story, originally published on July 20, has been updated to include additional expert comments regarding the global zero-day attack impacting Microsoft on-premise SharePoint Server users, as well as the latest information and advice from Microsoft itself, along with a warning from CISA.\nMicrosoft users are, once again, under attack. This time, the threat is not restricted to Outlook users, or involves a Windows browser-based security bypass, and unlike the recent Windows authentication relay attack vulnerability, there is no patch, no magic update, to remedy this one. Which is bad news for Microsoft SharePoint Server users, as CVE-2025-53770 is currently under confirmed “mass attack” and on-premises servers across the world are being compromised. Here’s what you need to know and do.\nIt’s been quite the few weeks for security warnings, what with Amazon informing 220 million customers of Prime account attacks, and claims of a mass hack of Ring doorbells going viral. The first of those can be mitigated by basic security hygiene, and the latter appears to be a false alarm. The same cannot be said for CVE-2025-53770, a newly uncovered and confirmed attack against users of SharePoint Server which is currently undergoing mass exploitation on a global level, according to the Eye Security experts who discovered it. Microsoft, meanwhile, has admitted that not only is it “aware of active attacks” but, worryingly, “a patch is currently not available for this vulnerability.”\nCVE-2025-53770, which is also being called ToolShell, is a critical vulnerability in on-premises SharePoint. The end result of which is the ability for attackers to gain access and control of said servers without authentication. If that sounds bad, it’s because it is. Very bad indeed.\n“The risk is not theoretical,” the researchers warned, “attackers can execute code remotely, bypassing identity protections such as MFA or SSO.” Once they have, they can then “access all SharePoint content, system files, and configurations and move laterally across the Windows Domain.”\nAnd then there’s the theft of cryptographic keys. That can enable an attacker to “impersonate users or services,” according to the report, “even after the server is patched.” So, even when a patch is eventually released, and I would expect an emergency update to arrive fairly quickly for this one, the problem isn’t solved. You will, it was explained, “need to rotate the secrets allowing all future tokens that can be created by the malicious actor to become invalid.”\nAnd, of course, as SharePoint will often connect to other core services, including the likes of Outlook and Teams, oh and not forgetting OneDrive, the threat, if exploited, can and will lead to “data theft, password harvesting, and lateral movement across the network,” the researchers warned.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has already added CVE-2025-53770 to the Town Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, and action that, in accordance with Binding Operational Directive 22-01, mandates U.S. Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to remediate the threat within 21 days. “Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies,” CISA said, “CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation.” Given that no patch is yet available, that could mean taking drastic action and pulling the internet plug to remove connectivity from SharePoint servers.\n“While cloud environments remain unaffected,” Michael Sikorski, head of threat intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, said, “on-prem SharePoint deployments, particularly within government, schools, healthcare including hospitals, and large enterprise companies, are at immediate risk.” The attackers are, Sikorski confirmed, exfiltrating data, deploying backdoors, and stealing cryptographic keys. “If you have SharePoint on-prem exposed to the internet, you should assume that you have been compromised at this point.”\n\"CVE-2025-53770 is more than just another SharePoint flaw,” Rik Ferguson, vice president of security intelligence at Forescout, warned, “it’s a case study in what happens when legacy trust models meet modern threat actors.” Explaining that authenticated users should never be considered safe entities by default, Ferguson said that CVE-2025-53770, in effect, provides code execution ability without requiring any elevated privileges whatsoever. “For CISOs,” Ferguson concluded, “this highlights a critical point: If your security posture still relies on perimeter trust or the assumption that credentialed access equals safety, then it is time to reassess.”\nWhile the Microsoft Security Response Center has stated that it is “actively working to release a security update,” and will “provide additional details as they are available,” there is no patch at the time of writing. In the meantime, it advised that customers should apply the following mitigations:”\nConfigure Antimalware Scan Interface integration in SharePoint and deploy Defender AV on all SharePoint servers. “If you cannot enable AMSI,” Microsoft said, “we recommend you consider disconnecting your server from the internet until a security update is available.”\nI have approached Microsoft for a statement and will update this story with any further developments. In the meantime, Microsoft has confirmed that the issue only applies to on-premises Microsoft SharePoint Servers only, with SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365 not impacted.",

    "full_content": "A U.S. envoy has reaffirmed Washington's support for Syria's new government, stating there is \"no Plan B\" for uniting the country\nBEIRUT -- A U.S. envoy doubled down on Washington's support for the new government in Syria, saying Monday there is “no Plan B\" to working with the current authorities to unite the country still reeling from a nearly 14-year civil war and now wracked by a new outbreak of sectarian violence.\nTom Barrack took a critical tone toward Israel’s recent intervention in Syria, calling it poorly timed and saying that it complicated efforts to stabilize the region.\nBarrack, who is ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria and also has a short-term mandate in Lebanon, made the comments in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press during a visit to Beirut. He spoke following more than a week of clashes in the southern province of Sweida between militias of the Druze religious minority and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.\nSyrian government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up siding with the Bedouins before withdrawing under a ceasefire agreement with Druze factions. Hundreds have been killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly shot dead Druze civilians and burned and looted their houses.\nIn the meantime, Israel intervened last week on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military. Israel launched dozens of strikes on convoys of government forces in Sweida and also struck the Syrian Ministry of Defense headquarters in central Damascus.\nOver the weekend, Barrack announced a ceasefire between Syria and Israel, without giving details. Syrian government forces have redeployed in Sweida to halt renewed clashes between the Druze and Bedouins, and civilians from both sides were set to be evacuated Monday.\nBarrack told the AP that “the killing, the revenge, the massacres on both sides” are “intolerable,” but that “the current government of Syria, in my opinion, has conducted themselves as best they can as a nascent government with very few resources to address the multiplicity of issues that arise in trying to bring a diverse society together.” At a later press conference he said the Syrian authorities “need to be held accountable” for violations.\nRegarding Israel's strikes on Syria, Barrack said: “The United States was not asked, nor did they participate in that decision, nor was it the United States responsibility in matters that Israel feels is for its own self-defense.\"\nHowever, he said that Israel's intervention \"creates another very confusing chapter\" and “came at a very bad time.\" \nPrior to the conflict in Sweida, Israel and Syria had been engaging in talks over security matters, while the Trump administration had been pushing them to move toward a full normalization of diplomatic relations.\nWhen the latest fighting erupted, “Israel’s view was that south of Damascus was this questionable zone, so that whatever happened militarily in that zone needed to be agreed upon and discussed with them,” Barrack said. “The new government (in Syria) coming in was not exactly of that belief.”\nThe ceasefire announced Saturday between Syria and Israel is a limited agreement addressing only the conflict in Sweida, he said. It does not address the broader issues between the two countries, including Israel's contention that the area south of Damascus should be a demilitarized zone.\nIn the discussions leading up to the ceasefire, Barrack said “both sides did the best they can” to came to an agreement on specific questions related to the movement of Syrian forces and equipment from Damascus to Sweida.\n“Whether you accept that Israel can intervene in a sovereign state is a different question,” he said.\nHe suggested that Israel would prefer to see Syria fragmented and divided rather than a strong central state in control of the country.\n\"Strong nation states are a threat — especially Arab states are viewed as a threat to Israel,\" he said. But in Syria, he said, “I think all of the the minority communities are smart enough to say, we’re better off together, centralized.”\nThe violence in Sweida has deepened the distrust of minority religious and ethnic groups in Syria toward the new government in Damascus, led by Sunni Muslim former insurgents who unseated Syria's longtime autocratic ruler, Bashar Assad, in a lightning offensive in December.\nThe attacks on Druze civilians followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, to which Assad belongs, earlier this year in sectarian revenge attacks on the Syrian coast. While interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has promised to protect minorities and punish those who target civilians, many feel his government has not done enough. \nAt the same time, Damascus has been negotiating with the Kurdish forces that control much of northeast Syria to implement an agreement that would merge the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces with the new national army.\nBarrack, who spoke to SDF leader Mazloum Abdi over the weekend, said he does not believe the violence in Sweida will derail those talks and that there could be a breakthrough “in the coming weeks.”\nNeighboring Turkey, which wants to curtail the influence of Kurdish groups along its border and has tense relations with Israel, has offered to provide defense assistance to Syria.\nBarrack said the U.S. has “no position” on the prospect of a defense pact between Syria and Turkey.\n“It’s not in the U.S.’s business or interest to tell any of the surrounding nations with each other what to do,” he said.\nBarrack's visit to Lebanon came amid ongoing domestic and international pressure for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah to give up its remaining arsenal after a bruising war with Israel that ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement in November.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Beirut Monday, Barrack said the ceasefire agreement “didn’t work.”\nIsrael has continued to launch near-daily airstrikes in Lebanon that it says are aimed at stopping Hezbollah from rebuilding its capabilities. Hezbollah has said it will not discuss disarming until Israel stops its strikes and withdraws its forces from all of southern Lebanon.\nWhile the U.S. has been pushing for Hezbollah's disarmament, Barrack described the matter as “internal” to Lebanon. \n“There’s no consequence, there’s no threat, there’s no whip, we’re here on a voluntary basis trying to usher in a solution,\" he said. He added that the U.S. “can’t compel Israel to do anything” when it comes to the ceasefire.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "full_content": "An Albanian court has begun the corruption trial of former Prime Minister Sali Berisha\nTIRANA, Albania -- An Albanian court on Monday started the trial on corruption charges of former Prime Minister Sali Berisha, who leads the opposition Democratic Party.\nThe trial for Berisha, 80, at the Special Court for Corruption and Organized Crime, which covers cases involving senior officials and politicians, also includes his son-in-law and three other people.\nIn October 2023, prosecutors put Berisha under investigation for allegedly abusing his post to help his son-in-law, Jamarber Malltezi, privatize public land to build 17 apartment buildings in the capital, Tirana. \nIn September 2024 Berisha was formally charged with corruption in connection with a property deal. He has denied the charges, describing them as political repression ordered by Prime Minister Edi Rama of the left-wing Socialist Party. \nOn Monday, Berisha reported to the prosecutor's office, as required every two weeks, but said he did not go to the court where he was represented by his lawyers.\n“My presence or not is set from my lawyers and naturally in line with the laws,” he told journalists. “That is a session where my lawyers will present their claims.”\nBerisha was prime minister from 2005-2013 and served as president from 1992-1997. He was re-elected as a lawmaker for the center-right conservative Democratic Party in the 2024 parliamentary elections.\nThe United States government in May 2021 and the United Kingdom in July 2022 barred Berisha and close family members from entering their countries because of his alleged involvement in corruption.\nCorruption remains a top issue that has continuously negatively affected Albania since the fall of the communist regime in 1990.\nBeside Berisha, former President Ilir Meta and members of Berisha’s opposition coalition have also been detained and investigated on corruption charges. Both say the charges are politically motivated, accusing the government of corruption.\nIn October last year, Tirana started full membership negotiations with Brussels on aligning with the European Union on the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and the fight against corruption. Albania aims to join the bloc by 2030, according to Rama.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "full_content": "The prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi has been charged with unlawful possession of ammunition in a case stemming from his alleged role in street protests against the government\nNAIROBI, Kenya -- The prominent Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi was on Monday charged with unlawful possession of ammunition in a case stemming from his alleged role in street protests against the government. \nOpposition leaders and Mwangi's followers had feared he would be charged with the more serious offense of terrorism. \nHe was freed on bond immediately after his appearance in court on Monday. \nThe charge sheet said the suspect possessed three canisters of tear gas without lawful authorization. His attorney, Njanja Maina, told reporters on Sunday that Mwangi never possessed such items. \nMwangi's wife Njeri, in a post on the social media platform X, said on Saturday that security personnel raided their home and took the activist and his electronic gadgets while “talking of terrorism and arson.” Police said after his arrest on Friday that Mwangi was linked to the facilitation of violent activities in recent street protests. Detectives searched his home and his office.\nThe Kenya Human Rights Commission described the ammunition charge as a “trumped-up accusation.”\n“This pattern of inventing charges to harass and silence activists like Mwangi erodes public confidence in the independence” of the justice system, the civic group said.\nThe rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Monday that legal action against Mwangi appears to be “part of a broader effort to intimidate lawful dissent and those committed to upholding the rule of law.”\n\"We are deeply concerned by the continued misuse of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to manage public order in more than 100 other cases,\" Amnesty said. “This practice undermines Kenya’s criminal justice system and jeopardizes critical international partnerships aimed at safeguarding national security.”\nMwangi is a well-known pro-democracy activist in Kenya. On X, where he has 2 million followers, he describes himself as \"The People’s Watchman.” He has been a critic of successive Kenyan governments. \nProtesters who have rocked President William Ruto's administration say they want to rid his government of corruption, marked by theft of public resources and the seemingly extravagant lifestyles of politicians. \nThey also say that Ruto, in power since 2022, has broken his own promises to working-class Kenyans. The protests started in mid-2024 when Ruto proposed aggressive new tax measures opposed by many Kenyans. \nAt least 500 people are facing criminal prosecution following arrests during protests in June and July that resulted in at least 47 deaths. \n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

But the just-signed legislative package would allow a tax deduction that employers previously used for providing meals and snacks to expire in most cases. Congress seems to think the savings are worth it: The Joint Committee on Taxation found that eliminating the deduction will raise $32.5 billion over the next decade.\nEven without the tax break, free food is a major draw. In a 2023 survey, 80% of workers said catered meals encourage them to come into the office.\nTransportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy speaks during a press conference at Los Angeles Union Station in February 2025.\nCalifornia is suing the Trump Administration over its claw back of $4 billion in federal funds awarded for a high-speed rail system in the works, the latest difficulty facing the country’s costliest infrastructure project. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said a compliance review determined the California High-Speed Rail Authority “cannot meet its obligations under the grant agreement,” but Governor Gavin Newsom claimed the decision was politically motivated.\nMicrosoft released an emergency software patch Sunday in response to “active attacks” on businesses, government agencies and universities using its SharePoint server. The vulnerability only impacts companies using Microsoft’s software to host their own servers, and customers relying on Microsoft’s 365 cloud services have not been affected.\nAmericans appear to be less worried about price hikes, as consumer sentiment reached a five-month high last month, according to the University of Michigan’s monthly survey released Friday. Inflation was higher than economists expected in June, and those polled in the survey still see a “substantial risk” of worsening inflation in the future.\nAI chatbot Grok has touted shifting viewpoints on disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein in recent days, including apologizing for “overly definitive or inflammatory posts” about Epstein’s demise that preceded a system update. It’s showing in real time how the flagship product of Musk’s AI firm, which recently won a $200 million contract with the Pentagon and was last valued at $80 billion, is evolving and influencing discourse on X.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi during a Cabinet Meeting with President Trump at the White House in Washington, on July 8, 2025.\nAt President Donald Trump’s direction, Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to ask the court to unseal grand jury documents related to Epstein—but it could take months for any documents to actually be released, if they’re permitted to come out at all. Grand jury proceedings are typically secret, and files from them can only be released in limited circumstances. Over the weekend, Trump continued to blast “troublemakers and radical left lunatics” who he predicted would still want “more, more, more.” \nMORE: Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) alleged in a series of letters that FBI agents were directed to “flag” anything in the government’s documents on Epstein that mentioned Trump. Democrats have urged the FBI and DOJ for more information about their refusal to publicly release more evidence, after Bondi previously said the public would see “the full Epstein files.”\nTrump sued billionaire media magnate Rupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal’s publisher Dow Jones & Co. on Friday, after it published a report alleging the president sent a suggestive letter to late sex offender Epstein on his 50th birthday. Trump filed the lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida alleging libel, assault and slander against Murdoch, Dow Jones and the two reporters behind the Journal’s story.\nThe recently-approved spending package changes controversial reporting requirements for gig workers and those who use payment apps like PayPal for business by changing the reporting thresholds for several tax forms. That should translate to fewer forms for taxpayers, as there are around 16.5 million self-employed individuals in the U.S., or 10.4% of the total workforce. But no matter the threshold, all taxable income must be reported on your tax return.\nPortugal, and its capital of Lisbon, encourages U.S. retirees who can show yearly income of $17,000 for a couple.\nA growing number of Americans are interested in retiring abroad, in search of lower costs, a different lifestyle and less toxic politics.\nA record 712,000 Americans living abroad were receiving Social Security benefits at the end of 2024, up 21% in a dozen years.\nIn many cases, the day-to-day living economics are compelling. And that’s on top of a growing number of countries, including Greece, Portugal and Costa Rica, that have recently relaxed rules that used to keep retirees from bringing in extra income by working. New “digital nomad” visas allow American expats to stay for an extended period, while working remotely for employers in other countries.\nTo help you get started on research, Forbes offers its list of The Best Places to Retire Abroad in 2025, highlighting 96 places in 24 different countries in four continents, plus islands. Ten of the 24 are in Europe.\nIn making our picks, we considered relative cost of living, healthcare quality and costs, ease of getting back to see relatives, crime and political instability and social isolation, especially if English isn’t widely spoken. We also weighed the current ease or difficulty of getting permission to stay in a country.\nThe list includes places like Malta, a five-island nation with terrific beaches, a temperate climate and low crime, and Belize, the only Central American country with English as its official language.\nWHY IT MATTERS “Retiring abroad is certainly not for everybody,” says William P. Barrett, a Forbes senior contributor and veteran journalist who has been compiling these lists for more than a decade (and who has lived abroad). “But when you look at what’s going on in the U.S. today—everything from rising living and health care costs to a political environment that many of all ideological stripes find unsettling—a foreign option looks a lot more appealing than in the past. And then there’s also the change of pace and opportunity to experience different cultures often in beautiful settings—in many cases, at a discount!”\n“No doubt more folks dream about doing this than actually do it. One reason might be that it takes a lot of research. One purpose of the list is to give folks a road map and a head start.”\nMORE Your Guide To Planning A Foreign Retirement\nJune is typically a slow month for retail, but consumers spent more than expected last month as shoppers appear to be in a “wait-and-see” mindset amid broader economic uncertainty.

A new survey by resume-builder LiveCareer (aptly titled the PTO Culture Crisis report) shows that, while almost half of American workers receive more than two weeks off, the majority plan to less than one week of summer vacation. A third of workers feel pressure not to use all their PTO (paid time off). The most unfortunate 9% of the more than 1,000 employees surveyed reported that their employer actively discouraged taking time off.\nDo not give up your rightful vacation time! Some companies don’t allow you to roll over unused time or get trade it for dollars, so your PTO ends up not being paid to you. In addition, you lose out on the rest and refreshment that can keep you from burnout. Finally, you signal to your employer that you don’t need or want your vacation time. Instead of forfeiting your vacation days, follow these four steps to reclaim your PTO:\nSketch out the next full year ahead with 100% of your PTO. You don’t have to ask for all your days upfront, but when you schedule out all of your vacation days in advance, you increase your odds of designing exactly what you want and need from your PTO. Block out both the fun and the necessary days you’ll need. Keep that calendar in a prominent place at home (not at work to keep it confidential) so your vacation stays top of mind.\nThink about individual days off you want (e.g., your birthday), family commitments you need extra time for (e.g., first day of school) and personal priority items that may require a workday (e.g., meeting your accountant for tax day). Then think about how you like to rest and recharge – would you prefer several three-day weekends or a full two-week trip somewhere? Pick specific time periods for those short or long vacations, so you can get your PTO approved in time. Finally, outline your vacation plans, and start making your wish lists for hotels, meals and excursions, so you create such an exciting vision for your time off that you actually take it (start with these five ideas for your time off).\nNow that you have your ideal PTO sketched out, look up your company’s vacation policies so you ask at the right time. There are likely rules around how much vacation time you can request in advance and when you need to ask. Follow these rules, and if you have an unsupportive manager, further plan your request for when your manager is in a good mood or there is a positive uptick in the business. Be prepared to negotiate if you hear No or are made to feel guilty for asking. Have an OOO (out of office) plan for how your work would get done in your absence, especially if you are taking off for a week or longer.\nIn addition to planning your work transition for when you’re away, plan for things going wrong. This contingency plan is for both you and your employer. On your end, you want peace of mind that your vacation won’t be interrupted at the slightest provocation. If you have key clients or projects, you don’t want to worry about these while you’re away. For your employer, whichever colleague covers you, they need to know what to do if something unexpected happens. When, if at all, should they contact you? How should they do that (e.g., text, call)? If your colleagues are poor performers who may disrupt your time off for non-emergency issues, then part of your planning may be to design your vacation to be unreachable (e.g., off-the-grid travel locations, inconvenient time zones).\nInstead of wondering when your next vacation is, maybe you should set up a life you don’t need to escape from – Seth Godin \nIf you really can’t pry yourself away from work, then still take those vacation days to work on your dream career or side business that might ultimately replace your current job. It can’t be that great a job if you can never leave it! This way, you’re still getting your PTO and even though you’re not using it to rest and refresh, you’re at least still investing in yourself.",

    "full_content": "ByAllBusiness\n\nByAllBusiness,\n Contributor. \nBy Su Guillory\nLeaning into your expat status can actually enhance your credibility and personability.\nIf you’re an entrepreneur or small business owner, personal branding matters. More often than not, it’s your face that people associate with your business. But how do you maintain a solid personal brand when you live and work abroad? Here are some tips.\nThis is a great exercise for any business owner if you’ve never done it. Start by identifying your niche. Who do you serve? The more specific you can be, the better. For example, as an expat coach, my niche is women who want to move to Italy. Yes, I can help men, too, but my brand and marketing are aimed at women who are ready to change their lives by moving to Italy like I did!\nIf you can align your expertise with your expat story, great. Your experience can help you generate content for your blog and social media. I frequently write about the changes I’ve experienced living in Italy, and this is how 80% of my clients find me.\nLiving abroad may open the door to additional business opportunities. The key is finding a way to apply your business strengths to the local market.\nIf, for example, you’re a writer, you’re bound to meet locals who struggle to communicate with their customers in English. This could create an opportunity for you, as the resident expat writer, to take on local clients for bilingual content.\nStay open to the possibilities. Pay attention to how people react when you tell them what you do, and listen for opportunities.\nHaving an online presence is even more important if you’re living abroad. Select the digital channels where your target audience is most likely to be found and build your strategy accordingly. If you run a company serving B2B, you will likely get more out of your efforts on LinkedIn than TikTok, for example.\nMaximize the time you spend managing your online presence by using social media scheduling tools like Buffer. Keep in mind that your audience is in a different time zone, so schedule your content for the hours they’re most likely to view it.\nIf you serve clients back in your home country as well as your new country, consider having a profile in each language and posting content in both languages. LinkedIn allows you to create multiple versions of your profile in different languages, and with Facebook Pages, you can enable posts in multiple languages.\nRemember what makes you unique: in addition to whatever features and benefits your products or services offer, you have a story to tell, and that should be part of your personal brand.\nPeople are fascinated by expats who give up everything to move abroad. Find a way to weave your story into your business. Patti Perez, who conducts workplace investigation and leadership training, lives in Rome and frequently shares stories of her life as an expat, tying them back to the work she does. Lauren Bonheim, an expat coach, shares content about being an expat in Panama. These expats have found a way to use storytelling to brand themselves.\nIf your content leans more toward the informative or technical, find small ways to weave in a little personalization where possible. With such a flood of content available online, the surefire way to stand out is to show some of who you are.\nYou can also generate a little PR for yourself by pitching U.S. and international media outlets, podcasts, and blogs that are interested in the story of an expat entrepreneur.\nMore from AllBusiness:\nNetworking should be about building connections with others in your field, finding other expat business owners to connect with, and fostering relationships with potential customers.\nTo find others who get what it is to live abroad and run a business, look for expat groups in your area. You might be surprised how helpful and comforting it is to connect with other expat entrepreneurs. And you never know what collaboration opportunities might pop up! If there aren’t local groups in person, search for online expat groups for business owners, as they’ll be the group that gets your unique situation.\nIf you don’t have local customers, you’ll have to build your relationships online. Seek out groups and organizations that cater to your target market or industry. You can also participate in industry groups online, as well as attend online events and workshops to further your connections in your niche.\nEverything about your life changes once you move to another country, so give yourself some slack when it comes to building your personal brand abroad. You may find that you now prefer to work in the afternoons, since that’s when your clients are awake. You might decide to dedicate one day a week to scheduling social media and blog content, and work on serving your customers the rest of the week.\nRemember that automation tools are your friends. They will allow you to schedule blog posts and social media, as well as automate responses to customers. The key to solid branding is consistency, and that means you'll need to find a rhythm that suits your new expat lifestyle and be open to that changing over time.\nLiving in a country other than the one where you first launched your business doesn’t have to hinder your ability to build your personal brand. It can, in fact, enhance your credibility and personability. Even if you're 5,000 miles from your target market, you can still be top of mind. Focus on storytelling and weaving your expat experiences into your business messaging.\nSu Guillory is an expat coach and business content creator. She supports women who want to move to Italy. Su has been published on AllBusiness, Forbes, SoFi, Lantern, Nav, and more, and writes about entrepreneurship, finance, marketing, and living as an expat in Italy.",

    "full_content": "ByWes Moss\n\nByWes Moss,\n Contributor. \n\nTaking time for self-reflection can help individuals envision a future life beyond their primary ... More working years, transforming retirement from a distant, abstract destination into a familiar stop on life’s journey.\nResearchers affiliated with Harvard Business School recently conducted a decade-long longitudinal study on retirement behavior—tracking 14 individuals closely over ten years and surveying 106 more—revealing comparative insights into different retirement transition approaches.\nTheir findings, published in the 2024 Harvard Business Review article Retirement Without Regrets, present contrasting case studies, map common phases of retirement transition, and highlight behavioral frameworks retirees have used to increase their retirement success. A key takeaway: retirees often struggle when their vision of happiness is unclear or lacks purpose.\nCharting a course for retirement is difficult without a clear destination. The study illustrates this by contrasting two knowledge workers’ post-career lives—one who proactively envisioned a fulfilling retirement found happiness quickly, while the other became isolated and unhappy. Think of two people embarking on separate open-road adventures; the one with a map will likely enjoy a more efficient trajectory.\nFeeling a stronger connection to one’s future self may encourage more retirement saving.\nBuilding on this, another study, titled Back to the Present: How the Direction of Mental Time Travel Affects Similarity and Saving, explores deliberate foresight. Led by Katherine Christensen, assistant marketing professor at Indiana University, the research asked whether feeling a stronger connection to one’s future self would encourage more retirement saving. After 20 experiments, the answer was a clear yes.\nThe potentially game-changing retirement research found that more than 80% of the time, individuals imagining their future start by thinking about the present. Leveraging this, Christensen and her team flipped the typical mindset—by asking participants where they wanted to end up instead of where they were or how they would get there, they helped people overcome natural cognitive biases and adopt more productive saving behaviors.\nTime in the market typically beats attempts to time market fluctuations. Therefore, long-term planning can play a crucial role in unlocking the financial flexibility that helps to allow retirees to sleep well at night, free from the fear of depleting their nest egg.\nIn one experiment analyzing over 6,700 customers of a Swedish fintech company, individuals with low-balance savings accounts were 14% more likely to invest in a long-term savings product when prompted to think about their future selves first. The simple prompt used was: “The year is 2034… rewind back to 2024 and consider saving for 2034 you,” according to contributing author Hal Hershfield.\nIn one experiment analyzing over 6,700 customers of a Swedish fintech company, individuals with ... More low-balance savings accounts were 14% more likely to invest in a long-term savings product when prompted to think about their future selves first.\nThis straightforward mental technique might give future retirees a measurable edge with real financial impact. If they simply take the time to fully imagine their future retirement before mentally rewinding to the present, they may increase their chances of making more effective long-term investment decisions. Revisiting the open-road journey parallel: setting the GPS ahead of time improves the odds of arriving on schedule—and spotting roadblocks before they hit.\nThe return trip effect—the feeling that the journey home is shorter than the journey out—is often attributed to the way uncertainty stretches our perception of time. Christensen and colleagues suggest this cognitive quirk applies not just to miles but to years—shaping how people perceive the future and, critically, how they relate to retirement savings.\nTaking time for self-reflection can help individuals envision a future life beyond their primary working years, transforming retirement from a distant, abstract destination into a familiar stop on life’s journey.\nPracticed consistently, this exercise may help clear the fog of retirement uncertainty\nThe exercise begins by vividly imagining retirement: “What is life like? Where do I live? How do I spend my days?” Once that vision crystallizes, individuals mentally rewind to the present and ask, “What small step can I take right now to increase the probability of that future?” Practiced consistently, this exercise helps clear the fog of retirement uncertainty, creating a mental framework that drives action today in service of the life envisioned tomorrow.\nFuture obligations rarely spark the same urgency as today’s immediate needs and desires. It’s all too easy to put saving off until another day, as instant gratification often wins out over long-term planning. Rather than battling human nature head-on, the Back to the Present study reveals that with discipline and mindfulness, individuals can tangibly connect with their future selves—transforming retirement planning from conceptual to constructive.\nWhether viewed as a life hack, a mental technique, or a form of introspection, the driving idea of ... More this cognitive time travel is clear: Retirement isn’t just about growing a bank account.\nWhether viewed as a life hack, a mental technique, or a form of introspection, the driving idea of this cognitive time travel is clear: Retirement isn’t just about growing a bank account. It’s about buying the opportunity for peace of mind. The sooner a current or future retiree envisions their ideal life, the easier it becomes to take the first step toward building it. When practiced with consistency and intention, this exercise may help convert today’s modest savings into tomorrow’s purpose-filled retirement.\nThis information is provided to you as a resource for informational purposes only and is not to be viewed as investment advice or recommendations.

Dartmouth will never relent on these values.\"\nPresident of Dartmouth Sian Beilock's stance of neutrality on political issues is praised by conservatives, yet attacked by academics. (Getty)\nHARVARD PRESIDENT URGES THE SCHOOL TO ADDRESS LACK OF CONSERVATIVES ON CAMPUS\nYale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld slammed Beilock’s decision to decline to sign the letter.\n\"This is a mix of cowardice, hypocrisy, and naïveté,\" Sonnenfeld said. \"This is Trump’s classic playbook: divide and conquer.\" \n\"Everyone is entitled to their opinion,\" Beilock told the New Yorker when asked her about the criticism she has received for her decisions. \"People ask, ‘Why aren’t you suing Trump like Harvard?’ Well, [the Administration hasn’t] made those kinds of demands.\" \nPresident Donald Trump has suspended federal funding to every Ivy League school, except for Penn and Dartmouth, over investigations into anti-Israel protests that have taken place on their campuses since October 2023. \nBeilock maintains that the university’s position is \"saving the idea of the university,\" the New Yorker noted, citing a piece she wrote in the outlet last year explaining her approach.\nBeilock was the first female president appointed to Dartmouth in 2022. She formerly served as president of Barnard College.\nThe New Yorker noted that the Dartmouth president’s primary objective was to take \"aim at the perceived censoriousness of campus discourse.\" Beilock created \"brave spaces,\" a subversive play on the common phrase \"safe spaces.\"\nBuilding upon that sentiment, Beilock launched \"Dartmouth Dialogues\" to facilitate free speech and debate.\nA piece from the New Yorker details the embattled president, Sian Beilock, vowing to uphold viewpoint diversity amid the federal government’s feud with higher education, especially Harvard, and rampant antisemitism on college campuses. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)\nBeilock introduced a policy of \"institutional restraint,\" mandating that Dartmouth officials, employees and staff refrain from issuing \"institutional statements\" in order to \"provide space for diverse viewpoints to be raised and fully considered …\"\nThe New Yorker reported further that \"Beilock clashed with Wesleyan’s president, Michael Roth, over her adherence to what he called 'a new form of conformism.' Roth went on, 'As a heterodox person, and as a Jew, I’m very suspicious when my compatriots find a new religion, be it viewpoint diversity or be it institutional neutrality.'\"\nGEORGETOWN REFUSES TO CUT TIES WITH ISRAEL, STANDS UP TO PRESSURE FROM STUDENTS\nBeilock’s handling of campus protests in the wake of the Gaza conflict was condemned by students and faculty members.\nAfter police clashed with Dartmouth affiliates in a protest in May 2024 where an encampment was constructed, Beilock defended the actions of the police, adding that the encampments were a violation of the school’s policy and that their presence was necessary to prevent further violence. \nFollowing the events, a motion to censure Beilock was introduced by religion professor Christopher MacEvitt and history professor Annelise Orleck who were both arrested during the protest. \nBeilock was censured in a 183-163 vote.\nAn anti-Israel protest by Harvard students and sympathizers.  (JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP via Getty Images)\nAs of publication, more than 2,700 people signed an alumni petition to urge Dartmouth College to fight federal government attacks on higher education.\nThe petition claims that \"our institutions of higher learning face an unparalleled and thoroughgoing assault from the federal government,\" without directly mentioning the Trump administration.\nOn the other hand, Beilock's convictions have been praised by conservatives.\n\"Her ideas have earned praise from free-speech advocates, conservative publications, and members of the Trump Administration, along with furious condemnation from academic leaders convinced that universities must stand united against Trump,\" the New Yorker reported.\nHarmeet Dhillon, assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the US Department of Justice, whic is currently investigating most Ivy League institutions for antisemitism, was noted by the New Yorker as praising Beilock's efforts:\n\"I was so impressed to learn how Dartmouth (my alma mater) is getting it right, after all these years. Kudos to Dartmouth! I heard Jewish student applications are way up!\"\nA bicyclist passes a college tour group outside the Baker Library at Dartmouth College, April 7, 2023, in Hanover, N.H.  (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\n\"I like my president,\" Jeff Immelt, the former CEO of GE, reportedly wrote on LinkedIn.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \nBeilock did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nJoshua Q.

We’re deeply grateful for their service, and for the strength and professionalism they brought to this mission.\"\nThe Pentagon’s decision to have the Marines leave LA comes after half of the National Guard troops were ordered to leave the city last week.\nLA Mayor Karen Bass called the withdrawal of troops \"another win for Los Angeles.\"\nMARINES STILL NOT ON LA STREETS, SEEN IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT TRAINING\nA person holds a sign in front of federal agents at MacArthur Park Monday, July 7, 2025, in Los Angeles.

We took the administration to court and won, now we continue that momentum with today’s news. Los Angeles stands with our troops, which is why we are glad they are leaving.\" \nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration for deploying California National Guard troops despite his opposition. He argued that the National Guard troops were likely violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.\nHEGSETH SPARS WITH SENATE DEMOCRATS OVER MARINE DEPLOYMENT TO LA ANTI-ICE RIOTS: 'NOT ABOUT LETHALITY'\nA law enforcement officer fires a less-lethal projectile during a protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles.  (Noah Berger)\nNewsom won an early victory in the case after a federal judge ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump’s authority. An appeals court tossed that order, and control of the troops remained with the federal government.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.\n      \nFounder of Live Action, Lila Rose, told Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump's move to pull funding from Planned Parenthood is a \"positive step\" but a \"small step forward,\" as the nonprofit receives hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\nA judge on Monday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from stripping Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood after Congress and President Donald Trump agreed to partially defund the nonprofit through passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\nJudge Indira Talwani of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts said in her order partially granting a preliminary injunction that the bill unconstitutionally punishes Planned Parenthood member organizations that do not provide abortions. \nThe injunction will risk \"at most minimal harm—financial or otherwise—to the Trump administration while the lawsuit proceeds,\" Talwani, an Obama appointee, wrote.\nSENATE PARLIAMENTARIAN OKS BAN ON PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERAL FUNDING IN TRUMP MEGABILL\nPro-life demonstrators gather in front of the Supreme Court building as the Court hears oral arguments over Medina vs Planned Parenthood in Washington D.C. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\nTalwani’s order arose from a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive budget bill that passed Congress this month with no Democrat support. Trump signed the bill into law on July 4.\nA provision in the bill stripped Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, which the nonprofit said could force it to close about 200 of its 600 facilities and deprive about half of its customers, more than one million people, of services that do not include abortion.\nPlanned Parenthood attorneys noted in court filings that Medicaid does not cover abortion.\nJUDGE TORCHED FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD ORDER: HER COURT LOOKS ‘LIKE A FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU’\nA Planned Parenthood sign (ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images)\nThe attorneys argued that cancer and sexually transmitted infections would go undetected, especially for low-income people, and that more unplanned pregnancies would occur because of a lack of contraception access. They said the consequences of losing Medicaid funding \"will be grave.\"\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) attorneys had previously argued in court filings that the purpose of the budget provision was to stop \"federal subsidies for Big Abortion\" by freezing federal funds for certain Medicaid recipients who provide abortions. Weakening Planned Parenthood has been one of the pro-life movement's leading priorities since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\nTalwani granted a temporary restraining order two weeks ago in favor of Planned Parenthood. The judge initially offered no explanation for her decision, a move that led to widespread backlash among Republicans who described it as judicial overreach. Days later, Talwani offered more context in a subsequent order.\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD USING 'LOOPHOLE' TO GET MINORS GENDER TRANSITIONS WITHOUT PARENTS' OK: WATCHDOG\nAnti-abortion activists march across the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol during the 50th annual March for Life rally on January 20, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nThe preliminary injunction will leave in place the pause on defunding Planned Parenthood indefinitely, but the Trump administration is likely to appeal the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.\nDOJ attorneys had previously argued to the court that blocking a measure that was passed by Congress and signed by the president was an extraordinary move and unjustified.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Beyond the futility of the claims on the merits, Planned Parenthood fails to demonstrate imminent irreparable harm to justify an injunction, asserting only classically reparable economic injury and irrelevant potential harm to patients, who are third parties not before this Court,\" DOJ attorneys wrote.\nAshley Oliver is a reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business, covering the Justice Department and legal affairs.

    "full_content": "ByRoberta F. Rodrigues\n\nByRoberta F. Rodrigues,\n Contributor. \nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA - JULY 19: Caitlin Clark #22 of the Indiana Fever and Sabrina Ionescu #20 of ... More the New York Liberty wears a shirt saying \"Pay us what you owe us\" prior to the 2025 AT&T WNBA All-Star Game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on July 19, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

(Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\nOn Saturday evening, WNBA players wore shirts that read “Pay What You Owe Us” during All-Star Game warmups, sending a clear message to Commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the board of governors that they are not backing down from their demand for a larger share of league revenue in the next collective bargaining agreement.\n“I think it was less about trying to make a statement, you know. And more about we gotta do something to make sure the statement is clear. Clear and cut,” said Kelsey Mitchell of the All-Star host team Indiana Fever.\nThe protest was organized during a players-only meeting Saturday morning, held to debrief a previous session on Thursday between the WNBPA and the league — a meeting that left many players frustrated.\n“To be frank, it was a wasted opportunity. We could really have gotten into a deeper dive of everything but it was a lot of fluff that we couldn’t get past,” said New York Liberty forward and WNBPA Vice President Breanna Stewart of the negotiations.\n“It sucks, because situations like that aren’t gonna happen again, because players are playing for different teams and this is the only time we have together.”\nPlayers such as the Liberty’s Natasha Cloud and the Seattle Storm’s Gabby Williams pointed to what they described as a patronizing tone from the league’s negotiating team.\n“I don’t think they were aware of how much we did understand of their proposal. I think they thought … personally, that they could just impress us with like some fancy numbers, some fancy language,” said Williams. “[They did] not think that we would actually understand what this meant for us as far as revenue share and everything.\n“Sometimes, I think our intelligence is insulted,” Cloud said. “We’re not just basketball players. We understand basic economics, we understand business models, we understand exactly where this league is and where this league is heading.”\nThe WNBA rejected the WNBPA’s initial proposal for a new CBA. Players harshly criticized the league’s counteroffer, with many calling it disrespectful or even “a slap on the face.” While the two sides appear to be aligned on issues like family planning and retirement benefits, revenue sharing remains the main point of contention.\nAfter the All-Star Game, veteran forward Nneka Ogwumike told reporters that the disagreement centers on two competing systems: the league is proposing a fixed percentage for salaries, while the players are pushing for a model that would allow compensation to grow alongside league revenue.\n“I don’t know that I’m going to say progress,” said Terri Jackson, WNBPA executive director, when asked about the state of the revenue sharing talks. “But we had spirited conversations.”\nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA - JULY 19: Brittney Sykes #15 of the Washington Mystics holds a \"Pay the ... More Players\" sign following the 2025 AT&T WNBA All-Star Game at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on July 19, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. NOTE TO USER: User expressly acknowledges and agrees that, by downloading and or using this photograph, User is consenting to the terms and conditions of the Getty Images License Agreement.  (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\nEngelbert seemed to have a much different outlook coming out of the meeting. Speaking at a press conference ahead of the All-Star Game, the commissioner said she was confident the two sides were making progress.\n“I want to share we had a productive meeting on Thursday with the WNBA PA and the players. We’re engaged in constructive conversations,” she said. “I remain confident we’ll reach a new CBA, one that’s transformational for the teams, players and owners for the future of our league.”\nWhen asked about players’ frustrations and the perception that the league wasn’t treating the meeting with urgency, Engelbert called it part of the negotiation process.\n“We also have to have a process where we go back and forth,” she said.\nWith the league planning a two-team expansion draft ahead of the 2026 season and more franchises expected in the following years, a new labor deal is crucial. The current CBA expires on Oct. 31.\n“Obviously, I have confidence we can get something done by October, but I’m not going to put an exact date on it because if we’re in a good place, we’re going back and forth, there’s a few remaining issues, we can extend dates here and there,” Engelbert said.\nStill, with the league, team owners and players at odds, the possibility of a lockout continues to grow.\nThe WNBA has never had a lockout. But with a surge in revenue from new media rights deals, record-breaking attendance, merchandise sales and sponsorships, risking a player strike could threaten the sustainable growth the league has long used to justify its spending limits and modest player salaries.\nDespite tensions, one positive takeaway from All-Star weekend was player engagement. The event allowed players, many from different teams and markets, to come together in person for a rare negotiating session. Around 40 players attended.\n“I appreciated how many players came to the meeting. I thought that was great. Communication is important. Having that meeting, being at the table, was important with that scale of players,” Engelbert said.\nStewart, despite her disappointment in the meeting’s substance, acknowledged its value.\n“Yesterday’s meeting was good for the fact that we could be in the same room as the league and the board of governors,” she said.\nIn addition to that session, players held another meeting Saturday morning to finalize the decision to wear the “Pay What You Owe Us” shirts before the game. Their message resonated with fans, who began chanting “Pay them more!” from the stands — a moment that did not go unnoticed by Ogwumike.\n“I think it [the narrative around the CBA] exceeded my expectations, and I think the players too lean very heavily in being able to use this platform,” she said. “We’ve also been so connected to the fans. Indianapolis was an amazing production for All-Stars — we want to continue to grow.”",

    "language": "en",
    "full_content": "ByOllie Barder\n\nByOllie Barder,\n Contributor. \n'Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion' is released this September.\nWith Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion out in a few months, I was lucky enough to catch up with the game’s producer, Kenichiro Tsukuda, about what we can look forward to.\nTsukuda also has a long history with mecha games, having worked on the older Armored Core games and Frame Gride at FromSoftware, also as a producer.\nI also interviewed Tsukuda for a UK games magazine around the time of Armored Core 3 back in 2002, so it’s nice to be able to talk to him again.\nConsidering it’s been over two decades since we last talked, I wondered what he’d been up to.\n“I moved to a development company called Feelplus, which later merged with Marvelous. During that time, I was involved in the development of various games, including the Fate/Extella series, Bakumatsu Rock, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, the Daemon X Machina series, and other various titles.”\n'Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion' is set 300 years after the first game.\nFEATURED | Frase ByForbes™\nUnscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase\nPinpoint By Linkedin\nGuess The Category\nQueens By Linkedin\nCrown Each Region\nCrossclimb By Linkedin\nUnlock A Trivia Ladder\nThe mecha in Titanic Scion are also closer in scale to power armor this time around, and Tsukuda was kind enough to explain why.\n“As technology advanced, mecha became smaller. Although this is science fiction and a mecha title set in a fictional world, incorporating elements of reality adds depth to that world. Our goal is also to enhance the player’s feeling of directly making a difference in the world as the main character.\n“With the anime-style mecha that appeared in the previous game, game design can be relatively straightforward because the mecha are only used for battle. However, by scaling down the size of the mecha and making the game open world, we were forced to rethink exploration, missions, and various other elements. And while I’m proud of the unique way our game allows players to move freely between the air and the ground, this increased freedom also required us to design the world with a greater focus on three-dimensionality and spatial awareness than we otherwise would have needed. We encountered various challenges along the way, such as players accidentally accessing areas they shouldn’t be able to reach, but the team persevered and successfully resolved these issues.\n“As for the bigger mecha seen in the trailers, yes, they will be playable with special controls. In this game, you can summon and use Heavy Armor, which are the previous game’s Arsenals, by building up your energy gauge during battle.\n“Regarding the controls, we’ve made it possible to fly more freely in the air by having your Arsenal respond to joystick inputs. Additionally, we've revised the controls to accommodate new mechanics. The basic control scheme hasn't changed significantly, and you can fully customize the key configuration, so players should be able to find a setup that suits them. This change was inspired by a letter we received from a single player. We also enhanced accessibility options in Daemon X Machina to make the game more inclusive.”\nYou now pilot power armor in 'Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion', although bigger mecha are also ... More available.\nThe story for the first Daemon X Machina was certainly one of its weaker points, but it seems things will be different this time around.\n“Titanic Scion is set about 300 years after the events of the first game, so similar to how the mecha have gotten smaller over time, we wanted to express how the change in time period would affect clothing and the appearance of people’s faces and bodies. I worked together previously with character designer Kimihiko Fujisaka on Bakumatsu Rock. He is well-known for his fantasy work, but his style always incorporates sci-fi elements. I consulted with him about depicting a world that has changed over time, and he agreed to take on the project. While we made many changes from the previous title, I believe Fujisaka’s characters have helped bring everything together.\n“This time, we set out to make a more accessible story by maintaining the same depth but narrowing the scope. We hold great respect for various works of science fiction, manga, movies, and anime, and I believe our story will resonate with fans of these genres, giving them a lot to think about. Take the robot character Toby, for example, who references the robot Astro Boy. Astro Boy was created by Dr. Tenma after his son died. However, Dr. Tenma’s son’s name was actually Tobio, and the name Toby was chosen as a tribute to him.\nFinishing up, I wanted to know what Tsukuda hoped players would enjoy most about the game.\n“I would like players to enjoy everything. We designed the gameplay so that players can experience everything. I also want players to jump into online play. Other players can revive you if you fall in battle while playing co-op, so there’s nothing to fear.”\nDaemon X Machina: Titanic Scion will be released on September 5 for Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, via Steam.\nFollow me on X, Facebook and YouTube. I also manage Mecha Damashii and am currently featured in the Giant Robots exhibition currently touring Japan.",

A police officer arrived about a half hour later to find the vehicles on fire and the suspect fleeing through a hole in the fence, it said.\nThe complaint said a lighter and a pair of sunglasses containing McCray's fingerprints were found at the scene, along with fire starters that had been placed under some undamaged vehicles.\nPolice estimated the replacement cost of the vehicles at $800,000.\nMcCray’s attorney, Ron Kuby, said his client, whom he described as an activist, was ordered released on the arson charge but remained in police custody on a separate misdemeanor count in Manhattan.\nAfter the vehicles were torched, Mayor Eric Adams suggested the suspect was connected to protests in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda.\n“Setting police vehicles ablaze is not a form of protest — it is a federal crime,” Joseph Nocella Jr., U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a news release Monday.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

    "full_content": "Australia’s Parliament has resumed after the center-left Labor Party won one of the nation’s largest-ever majorities in the May elections\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia’s Parliament resumed Tuesday for the first time since the center-left Labor Party won one of the nation’s largest-ever majorities in the May elections.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese thanked the traditional owners of the national capital Canberra at a Welcome to Country ceremony in Parliament House. He noted that such ceremonies performed by Indigenous people to welcome visitors to their traditional land at the start of a new parliament had been introduced by a Labor government in 2007.\n“In the 48th Parliament, we write the next chapter. Let us do it with the same sense of grace and courage that First Nations people show us with their leadership,” Albanese said.\nThe government has said the first legislation will be a bill to reduce student loan debt by 20%. The measure to be introduced Wednesday will benefit 3 million Australians with student loan debts and cost the government 16 billion Australian dollars ($10 billion).\nThe government also plans to introduce laws that would cut funding to child care providers who fail to meet quality standards and that would provide legal protections for some wage rates.\nLabor won 94 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives where governments are formed. Labor’s majority is the largest since Prime Minister John Howard's conservative coalition won 94 seats in 1996, when the lower chamber had only 148 seats.\nHoward stayed in power almost 12 years, and Albanese is the first prime minister since then to lead a party to consecutive election victories, following an extraordinary era of political instability.\nThe main opposition Liberal Party has elected its first woman leader, Sussan Ley, after one of the party’s worst election results on record.\nHer conservative coalition holds 43 seats in the House, while independent lawmakers and minor parties that are not aligned with either the government or opposition hold 13.\nNo party holds a majority in the 76-seat Senate. Labor holds 29 seats and the conservatives 27 seats. The Australian Greens hold 10 seats, which is the next largest bloc.\nThe government will likely prefer to negotiate with the conservatives or Greens to get legislation through the Senate, rather than deal with multiple minor parties and independents.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

More BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images)\nA regional competition in the Caribbean is expected next year to determine which nation will represent the West Indies at a global qualifier set to feature eight teams battling for the final men’s cricket spot at the Los Angeles Olympics.\nA group of mostly British Commonwealth countries and territories in the Caribbean region come together and compete as the West Indies, who are administered by a single governing body, but only sovereign nations are allowed at the Olympics.\nThe West Indies issue has been a conundrum ever since it was announced that cricket would make its long-awaited Olympic return having only previously been part of the 1900 Games.\nThe qualifying process for cricket’s six-team men’s and women’s T20 competitions has become clearer after the International Cricket Council’s annual conference in Singapore.\nThe ICC has yet to make any announcements but, as I first reported, regional rankings are set to mostly decide which teams make the cut for the men’s competition played from July 12-29 in Pomona, 30 miles east of Los Angeles.\nThe top ranked team in Asia, Oceania, Europe and Africa will automatically qualify at a cut-off date alongside host U.S, who would represent the Americas. The final spot will be determined by a single global qualifier likely to be held in 2027 and feature the highest ranked eight teams who did not automatically qualify.\nIndia are the reigning T20 World Cup champions (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images)\nIf the cut-off date was right now then India, Australia, England (who along with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland compete as Great Britain in the Olympics), South Africa and U.S. would automatically qualify.\nThe qualifier would comprise: New Zealand, nation from West Indies, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ireland and Zimbabwe.\nAllocation via the ICC’s T20 rankings at a cut-off date had been deemed as the likely outcome, but a compromise was reached after a groundswell of support for qualifiers as I reported last week.\nThe Caribbean regional competition will need to be held at some stage next year, well before the global qualifier.\n“We have established our Olympics committee, who will be responsible for advising the board how many countries will play in the regional qualifier,” Cricket West Indies president Kishore Shallow told me during an interview in Singapore.\n\"We welcome it, we embrace it. We’re going to try our best to see how we can use this exposure, this platform, to incentivize all our stakeholders.\n\"Hopefully this pathway to the Olympics is going to get greater investment from governments and corporates because the Olympic qualifier is a global event.\n“There will be more national interest and could also mean more commitment from players to play for their countries.”\nThe West Indies are two-time T20 World Cup champions (Photo by RANDY BROOKS/AFP via Getty Images) ... More \nRegional qualifiers to determine the limited number of Olympic spots had been the preference of smaller nations, but costs and logistics amid cricket’s cramped schedule made that not practical.\nBut the single qualifier is hoped to showcase the type of drama and spectacle that exists in rival sports such as basketball and its truncated game of 3x3. Cricket has not been made a permanent Olympic sport and the Los Angeles Games is seen as something of a trial run.\nCricket is tipped to be included for Brisbane 2032, with Australia being a powerhouse in the sport. But more teams, perhaps 12 per gender, will be hoped for Brisbane which could open the door for a combination of rankings and regional qualifiers.\nThe T20 World Cup is set to determine the women’s Olympic spots, but it is not yet known whether the U.S. - who have never qualified for a World Cup - will receive an automatic spot.",

In 2020, the company reduced its distribution to lower its debt levels and has since focused on repaying debt and funding most of its growth using free cash flow.\nApproximately 90% of Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET)’s EBITDA comes from fee-based services, shielding it from fluctuations in commodity prices. A significant portion of its contracts are structured as take-or-pay agreements, ensuring customers make payments regardless of actual usage. This model generates reliable, recurring cash flow, which helps sustain both its distribution and future growth initiatives.\nIn the most recent quarter, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) reported distributable cash flow of $2.1 billion. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.3275 per share and has a dividend yield of 7.50%, as of July 21. It is among the best dividend stocks under $20.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ET to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

    "full_content": "Tropical Storm Wipha made landfall in northern Vietnam Tuesday, bringing heavy rain and strong winds that knocked out power in parts of Hung Yen Province\nHANOI, Vietnam -- HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Tropical Storm Wipha made landfall in northern Vietnam on Tuesday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the country’s north and central regions.\nThe storm came ashore at 10 a.m. with sustained winds of 64–102 kilometers per hour (40–63 mph), and gusts up to 138 kph (86 mph), according to local weather officials. After landfall, it began moving southwest.\nWipha was classified as a typhoon on Monday while over open water, but weakened overnight and was downgraded to a tropical storm before reaching land.\nThe storm knocked out power in parts of Hung Yen Province, east of Hanoi. Residents rushed to gas stations to buy fuel for generators, state media reported.\nThe streets of capital city, Hanoi, were nearly empty as the storm moved inland. Most businesses were closed and the city government has advised residents to stay home and evacuate buildings that are unstable or in flood-prone areas.\n“If the storm is serious, people shouldn’t go out anyway because it would be dangerous on the road and there is also a chance of flooding,” said Minh Doan, a taxi driver in Hanoi.\nFlights were canceled across northern Vietnam, and airports in the port city of Hai Phong and Quang Ninh province were closed.\nNearly 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) of aquaculture farms and more than 20,000 floating fish cages are at risk from flooding and strong winds, according to state media.\nVietnam has warned of flooding as heavy rain from Storm Wipha moves inland.\nIn the Philippines, more than 80,000 people remain in emergency shelters after floods, landslides and tidal surges over the weekend. \nMost government offices and schools in the capital and 10 provinces were shut Tuesday due to widespread flooding from heavy monsoon rains, and droops evacuated residents from villages swamped by knee- to waist-deep water while the coast guard deployed buses and boats to assist stranded commuters. At least three people have died.\nGlobal warming is making storms like Wipha stronger and wetter, said Benjamin P. Horton, dean of the School of Energy and Environment at City University of Hong Kong. Warmer oceans give tropical storms more fuel, leading to more intense winds, heavier rain and shifting rainfall patterns across East Asia. “Rising sea surface temperatures, fueled by climate change, can intensify these storms,” he said.\n___\nHau Dinh in Hanoi, Vietnam and Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.\n___\nAssociated Press climate and environmental coverage receive support from several private foundations.

    "full_content": "When the KissCam at a Coldplay concert last week landed on a couple who suspiciously escaped their embrace and tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work\nNEW YORK -- When the “KissCam” at a Coldplay concert landed on a couple who tried (but failed) to duck out of the spotlight, the internet immediately got to work. \nIn hours, the clip was just about everywhere. Endless memes, parody videos and photos of the pair's shocked faces filled social media feeds. Online sleuths rushed to identify who was on camera. Artificial intelligence and software company Astronomer eventually confirmed that its CEO and chief people officer were in fact the couple in the video — and announced the CEO's resignation over the weekend.\nThe incident's fallout has, of course, generated conversations about business ethics, corporate accountability and the repercussions that conflicts of interest among leadership can cause. But there are also broader implications at play in our increasingly online world — about the state of potentially being visible everywhere you go or tracked through “social media surveillance.\" Experts say it's more and more common for moments that may have been intended to be private, or at least reserved to a single physical venue, to make their way online and even go global today.\nSo in the era of lightning-fast social sharing and when cameras are practically inescapable, does being in public hold any expectation of privacy anymore? Is every experience simply fodder for the world to see? \nIt's no secret that cameras are filming much of our lives these days.\nFrom CCTV security systems to Ring doorbells, businesses, schools and neighborhoods use ample video surveillance around the clock. Sporting and concert venues have also filmed fans for years, often projecting playful bits of audience participation to the rest of the crowd. In short, the on-scene viewer becomes part of the product — and the center of attention.\nAnd of course, consumers can record just about anything if they have a smartphone in their pocket — and, if it's enticing to other social media users, that footage can quickly spread through cyberspace.\nEllis Cashmore, author of the book “Celebrity Culture,” proposes that the rapid fame of last week’s KissCam moment probably answers a question many have been asking for years: “Is the private life still what it was? And the answer is, of course, there’s no such thing as the private life anymore,” he notes. “Certainly not in the traditional sense of the term.”\n“I’m not sure that we can assume privacy at a concert with hundreds of other people,” adds Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism and Media. “We can’t assume privacy on the street anymore.”\nSome version of the KissCam has long been a staple at big events — from timeouts during sports games to romantic songs played by artists at their concerts. It’s easy to miss, but most venues have signs to inform the audience that they could be filmed during the event. What’s been different in more recent years, experts note, is how quickly those moments can travel beyond the physical space where they actually unfold.\nThat isn’t only limited to what shows up on a jumbotron. Sometimes it only takes one person in the crowd to capture any interaction on their phone and post the video online — where it can zip around the world.\n“It’s not just the camera,\" Bock says. “It’s the distribution system that is wild and new.”\nThen there's the second ring of exposure — what happens after the video or photos spread. \nExperts point to growing instances of social media users rushing to publicly identify, or dox, the people captured on camera — much like how quickly the internet committed to finding those involved in the Coldplay moment, for example. The LinkedIn pages belonging both to Astronomer’s now-former CEO and chief people officer remained disabled on Monday, and The Associated Press could not reach either for comment.\nBut it isn't limited to company executives. Beyond someone simply spotting a familiar face and spreading the word, technological advances — including AI — have made it easier and faster overall to find just about anyone in an online post. This can happen with videos and photos shared on social media each day, even if it doesn't go viral, experts warn.\n“It’s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us — and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" Bock says. “When you think about it, we are being surveilled by our social media. They’re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.”\nAnd of course, such moments can also impact people who were not actually on camera. As easy as it can be to be identified online today, the internet is notorious for cutting a broad swath or not always getting it right. That sometimes produces harassment of individuals not actually involved. \nAt last week's Coldplay concert, for example, many social media users speculated that a third person seen near the two caught on camera was another Astronomer employee — leading to swarms of posts targeting her. But the company later confirmed that she was not at the event and said no other employees were in the video circulating online.\nFor the now-viral moment, “we can talk about what’s right and wrong, and whether they deserved it,” says Alison Taylor, a clinical associate professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Still, it’s a “very frightening thing to get a lot of abuse and harassment online,” Taylor notes. “There are real human beings behind this.”\nIt’s hard to think that that these kind of viral moments will ever go away — and there are few legal restrictions to stop users from sharing clips of interactions recorded from anything from a concert to the street widely online. But on an individual level, Bock says it can be helpful to “think before you share” and question whether something’s really accurate.\n“Social media has changed so much,” Bock says. “But we really have not, as a society, caught up with the technology in terms of our ethics and our etiquette.”\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Hilary Fox and Kelvin Chan contributed to this report.\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

More eyeglasses at a Remote Area Medical (RAM) mobile dental and medical clinic on October 7, 2023 in Grundy, Virginia. More than a thousand people were expected to seek free dental, medical and vision care at the two-day event in western Virginia's rural and financially struggling area. RAM provides free medical care through mobile clinics in underserved, isolated, or impoverished communities around the country and world. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\nBridging the Gaps That Separate Care from Communities\nIn the first essay of this series, I described the rural health crisis: how it affects nearly 60 million Americans and why its resolution should be a national priority. But if we want to fix it, we must first understand what “access” really means in rural America. It’s not simply a matter of miles. It’s a complex web of economic, structural, cultural, and technological gaps that separate people from the care they deserve.\nAs a physician, I’ve cared for transplant patients who came to me in Nashville from coal towns in Appalachia, from the Mississippi Delta, from isolated ranchlands in the West. I’ve treated veterans at VA hospitals and seniors from small towns served by Medicare. I’ve helped build companies like Aspire Health, Monogram Health, and Main Street Health that now deliver care to patients in their homes across rural America. And for years I had a front row seat on the explosion of telemedicine as a board member of Teladoc, which has served millions of rural residents.\nWhat I’ve seen, again and again, is this: geography is only the first barrier. The deeper challenge is designing care that rural Americans can reach, afford, and especially trust. Care that understands them.\nThe Many Faces of “Access”\nAt its simplest, access to care means being able to engage a health provider when you need it. But in rural America, this ideal runs into five major roadblocks:\nAccording to national polling by KFF, 58% of Americans believe rural residents have a harder time accessing care than urban ones. And rural adults themselves overwhelmingly agree that their communities lack primary care, mental health providers, and specialists.\nThis is not a perception problem; it’s a systems problem. And this needs to be addressed as such.\nWhen the Nearest Hospital Is Hours Away\nSince 2010, over 130 rural hospitals have closed. In my own state of Tennessee, over this period 15 rural hospitals have either fully closed or ceased inpatient care, the second most of any state and the highest in the nation on a per capita basis. In many areas, emergency rooms, surgical units, and maternity wards have been eliminated, with nothing to replace them. Remaining facilities increasingly operate under severe financial strain.\nAs Dr. Keith Mueller of the University of Iowa notes: “In rural America, we haven’t just lost hospitals. We’ve lost healthcare ecosystems.”¹ Doctors and nurses move away. Supporting clinics close. Pharmacies disappear. The closures don’t just threaten lives. They impact the economy, jobs, and social cohesion. The loss of a hospital often signals the slow unraveling of the community around it. One analysis found that for every 100 rural hospital jobs lost, another 35 jobs disappear due to declining local spending.\nThis is not an argument that all rural hospitals should necessarily stay open, because they may be too inefficient and may not be the best way to deliver care when resources are limited. But it is a call to explore newer models of care delivery to fill the gaps caused by the failure of traditional, legacy-type delivery of inpatient care. It is a call to explore more creative, rural-focused payment mechanisms that adequately support modern value-driven care.\nA Workforce Crisis—and an Opportunity\nMore than 60% of federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas are rural. Nearly 80% of rural counties lack a psychiatrist. Many have no dentist or OB-GYN. Some have no practicing physician at all. These are the hard facts we must work around.\nWe know that the best predictor of whether someone will practice in a rural area is whether they grew up in one. This truth means we should more actively invest in rural high school health career programs, community college training, and rural-focused medical education.\nIn Nashville, we’re working to open a Nurses Middle College, a public charter high school where students receive a rigorous college-prep education infused with nursing content, including nurse mentorships and firsthand experiences in medical workplaces. Introducing medical career paths early in students’ education, particularly in rural regions, is key to growing the workforce.\nA proven rural physician training model is East Tennessee State University’s Quillen College of Medicine in Johnson City. With the clearly stated mission to prepare physicians for underserved and rural communities, Quillen consistently ranks #2 nationally for graduates practicing in underserved areas. Through programs like its Rural Primary Care Track, Quillen provides early and sustained clinical exposure in community settings. The results are compelling: over 63% of its graduates practice in medically underserved areas, and more than half enter primary care, many returning to serve in their home regions.⁵\nAnother example of a training institution addressing this challenge head-on is Meharry Medical College in my hometown Nashville. A historically Black medical school with a long-standing mission to serve the underserved and in particular rural areas, Meharry has produced generations of physicians who return to practice in rural and economically marginalized communities. Through rural-focused pipeline programs and partnerships designed specifically for rural health like its accelerated training track with Middle Tennessee State University for rural primary care, Meharry is helping build a future workforce rooted in the very communities most often left behind.\nIn recent Senate testimony, Dr. James Hildreth, Meharry’s President and CEO, stated: “We have been training health care professionals who are really competent and skilled—connected to their communities—for decades.” He added, however, that “our challenge is the infrastructure we have to do that.”\nEqually important is expanding the role of non-physician providers. Nurse practitioners, pharmacists, EMTs, and community health workers are the care infrastructure in many places. States should continue to examine how to best allow health personnel to practice “at the top of their license” to maximize workforce reach.\nAnd the shortages are not just traditional health providers. In many rural areas, broadband technicians and community health workers are as critical to healthcare access as doctors and nurses.\nTelehealth: Promise and Pitfalls\nTelehealth surged during the pandemic and demonstrated real promise for rural care. Behavioral health visits, routine check-ins, and consults have all benefited. We’ve likely just touched the surface of its potential; to be fully realized will take newer alliances among providers and more modern flows of payment to reimburse where value is added.\nFarmer uses telemedicine to access remote care. \nTeladoc Health, on whose board I served for eight years, provides a good example. During the COVID pandemic, Teladoc Health emerged as a vital lifeline for rural Americans, illuminating how virtual care can break through geographic barriers. In early 2020, total visits soared. Teladoc nearly tripled its capacity, rising from handling around 100,000 virtual visits per week to nearly 2.8 million visits per month at mid‑year. While telehealth growth was nationwide, Teladoc’s platforms proved especially valuable in rural, underserved regions with few nearby providers or limited public transportation options. As a board member, I saw firsthand how Teladoc’s operations not only expanded reach into medically underserved counties but also reduced travel time, alleviated strain on fragile local health systems, and provided critical continuity of care where in-person follow-up was unfeasible.\nTelehealth has proved especially beneficial for mental health treatment, with some patients actually preferring a virtual visit due to persisting stigma around mental healthcare. And its value goes beyond connecting a rural patient to a provider in another zip code. It can be a lifeline for isolated rural providers who want to connect with specialists on cases and procedures they are less familiar with – becoming a medical force multiplier.\nBut telemedicine engagement generally requires broadband, and millions of rural Americans don’t have it. The FCC estimates at least 19 million Americans lack high-speed internet, the majority in rural areas. Even where broadband exists, it may be unaffordable or unreliable. Inconsistent access means rural residents are being left behind in a system increasingly reliant on digital care.\nWithout broadband, rural communities can’t participate in modern healthcare.\nBehavioral Health: The Sharpest Edge\nBehavioral health care is arguably where the rural access gap is most dangerous. Many counties have no licensed mental health provider at all. And yet, as pointed out in our first essay, rural communities face some of the nation’s highest rates of suicide, overdose, and depression.\nStates are in the best position to facilitate local solutions. In neighboring Kentucky, peer counselors, primary care teams, and churches have come together to form informal behavioral health safety nets, especially in rural areas where clinicians are scarce. One powerful initiative is Recovery Kentucky, which operates eight rural residential recovery homes offering peer-led support, life skills training, and transitional housing. An independent evaluation found it serves up to 2,200 people annually with measurable improvements in substance use, housing stability, employment, and health outcomes.⁵\nAnother innovation, the state’s Crisis Co-Response Model, pairs trained mental health professionals with law enforcement in rural communities to provide in-the-moment intervention and post-crisis follow-up, bridging gaps where conventional crisis services are hours away. These grassroots models reflect the power of trust-driven, community-rooted care that meets people where they are, both geographically and socially.\nIn rural America, the most effective health infrastructure is sometimes the church basement, the school gym, or the farm supply store bulletin board.\nSomething common to all of these rural models: they are built on trust, often from the community level up and not from bureaucracy, top down.\nWISE, VA - Early-morning screening takes place in a barn during the Remote Area Medical (RAM) clinic ... More at the Wise County Fairground in Wise, Virginia. Rural families, most with little or no insurance, lined up for hours to receive free health care from hundreds of professional doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health workers. (Photo by Suzy Allman/Getty Images, 2007)\nCulture, Trust, and Local Voice\nMany rural residents hold deep skepticism toward government-led systems, ironically even when they benefit from them. According to KFF polling, many residents on Medicaid or Medicare say they “don’t rely on the federal government” for health support.⁴\nThat belief is not hypocrisy; it’s identity. Self-reliance, pride, and cultural values shape how rural residents interact with healthcare. For many rural Americans, healthcare is much more than a service; it’s a cultural encounter. It intersects with deeply held values of personal independence, skepticism of bureaucracy, and strong community ties.\nHealth programs that emphasize entitlements or top-down aid can clash with this ethos. But solutions that build trust, use local messengers, and frame care as earned or community-rooted are far more effective. That’s why programs like culturally aware Main Street Health and peer-led behavioral health models work: they feel local, personal, and dignified. As one rural stakeholder said, “What matters is whether this person knows us, not what their credentials say.” Reaching rural America means respecting not just the need, but the values that shape how care is received.\nEffective models don’t dismiss that; they honor it. They empower trusted messengers.\nMain Street Health: A Working Solution\nAt Main Street Health, a company on whose board I serve that delivers value-based care exclusively to rural populations, we’re seeing what’s possible. The company has placed “health navigators,” trusted individuals drawn locally from their own communities, into hundreds of rural clinics across the country. These navigators, who are personally known locally, help seniors manage chronic conditions, access care, coordinate medications, and navigate the healthcare system.\nThe program now operates in more than a thousand clinics across the country. Its rapid growth is not because of marketing. It’s because it is built on community-centered relationships and trust, and it works.\nAccess isn’t a fixed obstacle. It’s a challenge of systems design and one we are capable of solving.\nWhat’s Next\nIn the next essay, we will explore how technology can be a transformative vehicle for health in rural America, and why we need to make these investments now to bring aging systems into the 21st century to help eliminate the “rural health penalty.” It just may be a model for the rest of America.\nFootnotes",

More meeting room. Videoconference presentation, global virtual group corporate training concept.\nMost people spend their prep time on content. They polish the story. Tweak the slide order. Clean up the numbers for the leadership team. Get the buy-in. But that’s not where the decision gets made. Not really.\nAI can help now. It’ll write the memo. Draft the deck. Sharpen your strategy. So your edge doesn’t come from what you present. It comes from what you perceive.\nWhen you walk into a room of executives, you’re not stepping into a presentation. You’re stepping into a live system. A space pulsing with history, hierarchy and half-spoken truths. Everyone’s got their own map of what matters. Some want speed. Some want cover. Some want to win. And some just don’t want to lose.\nYou might be there to pitch a project or get sign-off on a shift in direction. Maybe you’re chasing investment for a new platform. But long before your first word, the real decision is already circling—in the glances, in the pauses, in what’s left unsaid.\nYou’ll likely walk into a room where everything looks fine on the surface. But there’s something off. A quiet tension between two execs. A budget conflict you didn’t see coming. A project that steps on someone else’s turf. The deck is tight. The logic sound. But the room won’t move.\nReading the room isn’t polish. It’s survival. The roles below aren’t job titles. They’re tendencies, patterns, lenses. A CFO might be your Humanist. A CHRO might ask the hardest strategic question. People shift. But if you learn to see the need underneath the title, you won’t just present better. You’ll lead better.\nI didn’t always see it this way. Early in my career, when I was facilitating executive sessions or presenting strategy decks, I thought my job was to build consensus. To get everyone aligned, nodding, moving as one. But over years of working with hundreds of leadership teams—across workshops, boardrooms and hard decisions—I saw something else. The room doesn’t move because everyone agrees. It moves because enough people see their own path to the same outcome.\nThat’s equifinality.\nEquifinality is the idea that people can arrive at the same endpoint through different routes. In leadership settings, it means decisions don’t require identical thinking or full agreement. They require directional convergence. Each person may have a different motive, concern or lens, but they can still reach the same destination. If you’re focused only on consensus, you’ll miss the real alignment forming through tension, quiet resistance or fragile trust.\nLet’s say it’s Lena, the CSO. She’s looking at how your idea lands three moves from now—what bets it connects to, what it threatens, where it ladders into the future. You’ll likely see her pause when something doesn’t track. One misalignment with a prior commitment and momentum can vanish.\nWhat helps? Don’t just prove it’s smart. Show why it fits the larger system.\nWhat she’s thinking: If this knocks over something we’ve already committed to, we’re not aligned. And if we’re not aligned, we’re exposed.\nImagine Ray, the COO. Ray’s energy is forward. He wants the plan, the cost, the steps. If you take too long setting context, he tunes out fast. You’ll likely see him interrupt if the ask isn’t clear. He’s not being difficult, but indecision irritates him.\nWhat helps? Start with what you need. Be precise. Show the outcome.\nWhat he’s thinking: If you can’t lead me to action, how will you lead the project?\nLet’s say Priya, the CHRO, is in the room. She’s listening for impact—not just organizational but emotional. Who this helps. Who it leaves behind. Whether it builds or breaks trust. You’ll likely hear a question about voice or inclusion. One you hadn’t prepared for. It might stall your flow, but it’s not a derail. It’s a safeguard.\nWhat helps? Frame the people implications. Belonging, voice, dignity. Show care, not just competence.\nWhat she’s thinking: If this erodes trust, we’ll spend a year trying to rebuild it.\nPicture Jennifer, the CFO. Jennifer doesn’t attack. She asks. One sharp question at a time. She’s not blocking you. She’s stress-testing your thinking. You’ll likely hear a challenge to something foundational—your data set, your ROI logic, your timelines. If your answer is fuzzy, the room shifts fast.\nWhat helps? Name your assumptions. Bring clarity, not spin. Treat challenge like currency.\nWhat she’s thinking: If I find one soft spot, there are probably more. I can’t afford that risk.\nDiverse Modern Office: Businessman Leads Business Meeting with Managers, Talks, uses Presentation TV ... More with Statistics, Infographics. Digital Entrepreneurs Work on e-Commerce Project.\nNow meet Jen, Head of Ops. Jen isn’t chasing vision. She’s scanning for consequences. What breaks. Who’s accountable. What falls through the cracks. You’ll likely hear a blunt question about capacity. Or a quiet one about who’s covering the teams pulled into implementation. If there’s no answer, the plan can wobble.\nWhat helps? Bring a rollout map. Even rough. Show handoffs, pain points and where readiness might be overestimated.\nWhat she’s thinking: Don’t hand me a beautiful idea and expect me to clean up the fallout.\nAndre, VP of Innovation, is with you. He brings energy, belief and early support. But he also wants credit, visibility and voice. Cut him out and his support softens. You’ll likely hear him cool off mid-meeting if he feels excluded. A quiet shift. A missed reference. The belief stays, but the advocacy drops.\nWhat helps? Give him language, slides and soundbites. Let him shape the story.\nWhat he’s thinking: If I helped build this and then am forgotten, can I still trust you?\nThere’s one more participant in the room. Not human. Not on the agenda. But everywhere. The Machine—AI—now sits behind many of the decisions you’re pitching into. It has already briefed the COO. Summarized your report for the CFO. Flagged reputational risks to the CHRO. It’s surfacing issues, prompting questions and filtering tone in real time.\nYou’ll likely see someone checking a screen while you speak. That’s not distraction. That’s AI highlighting gaps or risk triggers. The Machine doesn’t argue. It surfaces. It shapes decisions one prompt at a time.\nWhat helps? Assume it’s working. Don’t bluff. Don’t bury tension. Name the tradeoffs yourself before it does.\nIt isn’t emotional. But it speeds up emotion. Speeds up judgment. Flattens nuance. And it makes refusal easier.\nThis is where decisions happen. Not in roles, but between them. The Decider and Operator might align fast but miss the risk the Strategist sees coming. The Advocate brings fire. The Skeptic brings water. You need both. The Humanist and Skeptic may clash. One wants care. One wants proof. Both want accountability.\nYou’ll likely see things fall apart not because someone objects but because no one bridges the tension between two others. Watch who defers to whom. Who goes quiet when someone speaks. Where silence lingers after a big ask.\nThis is the real noise underneath.\n“If this fails, it’s my name on the line”\n“If I stay quiet, I can’t be blamed”\n“Do I really trust the person pitching this”\n“If I say yes, do I own it”\nNo one says these things out loud. But they shape the room. Decisions don’t run on logic. They run on self-preservation, ego, risk, memory and trust. For great teams divergence isn’t dysfunction. It’s a recalibration tool.\nYou’re not just presenting. You’re reading, feeling, adjusting. You’re not there to impress. You’re there to sense what others won’t say. To catch the moment inside a pause. To name what’s hiding in someone’s silence.\nOne mistake people make is this. They think reading the room means stepping back. Like being a fly on the wall. But that’s not where influence lives.\nYou don’t belong on the wall. You belong in the center. Present. Grounded. Steady in your voice. The power of foresight doesn’t come from watching. It comes from placing yourself inside the room. Eyes up. Body tuned. Reading patterns. Feeling shifts. Sensing the energy that floats in and out like breath.\nBecause that’s what an executive room really is. A living thing. It breathes. It tightens. It exhales. It moves even when no one is speaking.\nAnd if you can feel that—if you can sense it with your whole body, not just your mind—you move with it. You match it. You shape it. The best presenters don’t walk out with praise. They walk out with momentum. Read the eyes. Read the silence. Read the room. That’s where leadership buy-in starts. And the decisions begin.",
