    "description": "Podcast host Joe Rogan remarked on his show that Texas State House Rep. James Talarico, D-Austin, should run for president because he is a \"good person.\"\n\nPodcast giant Joe Rogan suggested on his show Friday that his latest guest, Texas Democratic State Rep. James Talarico, D-Austin, run for president as Democrats scramble for a new leader.\n\n\"You need to run for president,\" Rogan told Talarico near the end of the nearly 3-hour conversation. \"We need someone who's actually a good person.\"\n\nThe two shared a laugh, though Talarico warned against people putting faith into one politician, regardless of whatever side of the aisle they support. He used Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whom Rogan has frequently supported, as an example.\n\nTEXAS DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER TORCHED FOR FAWNING OVER INDIVIDUAL 'SACRIFICE' FOR FLEEING THE STATE ON PRIVATE JET\n\n\"I like Bernie a whole lot, but some people treat him as if he's a messianic figure,\" Talarico said. \"And Trump on the right, people treat him as a messiah in some ways. This is a problem.\"\n\nHe added, \"The change is going to come from your listeners, not from me, right? I can be a part of that, but I mean, if there's any hope I can give people, it's that the people in power, including the billionaire mega-donors who basically run this whole thing, and I can get more into that if you want... But they are very afraid of the power that the people have. That I know for sure.\"\n\nTalarico has called himself a \"proud progressive\" in the past and has pushed back against Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nIn 2022, Talarico called Abbott \"the greatest public safety threat\" to the state following the Uvalde mass shooting.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\n\"You know me well, and I try to be careful with what I say, but Texans are dying. The kids in Uvalde, the teachers in Uvalde, the hundreds of Texas who died during the blackout last year, the Texans who died needlessly from Covid-19 because our governor chose to open bars too early in the pandemic. Greg Abbott is the greatest public safety threat in our state. He is the greatest public safety threat to Texans right now,\" Talarico said on MSNBC.\n\nBy contrast, Rogan has been outspoken about his opposition to lockdowns and has invited guests who have blamed the \"Defund the Police\" movement for the response to the Uvalde shooting.",

    "title": "Apple Roadmap Offers M5 MacBook Pro Release Dates",
    "description": "Update, Sunday July 20, 2025: This article has been updated with additional details on Apple's M5 roll-out.\n\nApple's iPhone has long had a steady cadence of releases, far more constant than the Mac portfolio. The last few years have felt like a similar annual update was being put in place, yet Apple's current roadmap is patchy at best, and MacBook Pro supporters may have to wait longer than they hoped.\n\nThe team at Apple Insider has laid out a potential Mac roadmap for 2025 and 2026. With 15 products on the list, it is a comprehensive look deep into 2026. That includes the highly anticipated M5 MacBook Pro and M5 MacBook Air.\n\nWhat the roadmap lacks is exact dates. For example, the M5 MacBook Pro release is listed as late 2025 and covers three models (presumably the MacBook Pro, MacBook Pro Max, and MacBook Pro Max). That could easily fit a mid-to-late October date that many felt Apple was using as the annual anchor. It could also coincide with a later launch in mid- to late-November, which would potentially result in only a handful of laptops being sold in December, with the bulk of retail devices arriving in January 2026.\n\nUnlike the first Apple Silicon M series MacBooks, which saw the MacBook Air lead off the new hardware, the M5 series will start with the late-2025 MacBook Pro models. The consumer-focused M5 MacBook Air models are expected to arrive in the first half of 2026, with March the likely window for the macOS laptop to arrive.\n\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch variants are expected to arrive simultaneously.\n\nUpdate, Sunday July 20, 2025. Apple's MacBook range is not the only hardware from Cupertino fighting for the M5 chipset. Last year, when Tim Cook and his team debuted the Apple Silicon M4 in May 2024, they also introduced the seventh-generation iPad Pro. Compared to the previous M2-powered iPad Pro, the chipset offered a 50 per cent uplift in CPU performance and x4 uplift in GPU performance.\n\nAs the only M4 hardware for many months, the iPad Pro set the conversation.\n\nWhile Apple has yet to announce the hardware that will utilise the presumptively named M5 chipset, let alone the M5 chipset itself, the iPad Pro could well be the debut hardware once more. Last year, the selfie camera shifted from the portrait orientation to the landscape orientation, enabling the iPad to be used comfortably in a laptop-like mode, especially with the addition of the Magic Keyboard. Yet that has led to an awkward UX for those who lean into portrait mode.\n\nWriting for the Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman notes that the new design for the iPad Pro will accommodate portrait and landscape selfie cameras, providing the option to comfortably use the camera for unlocking and video chat in both portrait and landscape modes.\n\nWith a similarly wide \"late 2025\" release date for the iPad Pro, the question now is if Apple will move to a joint launch of tablet, laptop and desktop, or if it will let the iPad Pro take pole position once more with the new Apple Silicon?\n\nThe M5 MacBook Pro and M5 MacBook Air models will bring more power to the platform thanks to the updated Apple Silicon M-Series chipsets, but for many Apple fans the rela update comes not with these two laptops, but with the laptops to follow.\n\nThe MacBook models slated to use the M6 chipsets are also slated to bring in the new hardware additions and redesign that many are waiting for. This includes the eagerly anticipated move away from the current LCD display to a more vibrant and power-efficient OLED display... a display option that high-end Windows laptops have offered for many years.\n\nThe M6 MacBooks are also expected to herald a redesign of the laptop itself with a chassis designed to be both thinner and lighter compared to the current models. Given this will line up with the 20th anniversary, it's a good moment to reinvigorate the brand and reinforce the place it has in Apple's portfolio.\n\nIn all this, there's one important piece of the jigsaw missing... Apple has yet to announce the M5 chipset. While there are many signs that it is coming (not least tucked away in the developer betas of macOS 26, the physical chip is nowhere to be seen. Last year's M4 was announced in early summer, but that anniversary has been and gone.\n\nThat's a delay of the M5 chipset to go alongside the delay of the MacBook Pro. Far from the 12-month cycle that the iPhone has, the M4 to M5 generation is looking more like an 18-month window to reach the mid-cycle upgrade.",

Accounting for inflation, that would mean at least £100bn will be spent, but only 135 miles of railway built. Many people involved - from civil servants, ministers and company insiders to HS2's original designers - have told me just how badly things went wrong.\n\nCertainly, the project has suffered from mismanagement, misplaced optimism and failures when dealing with homeowners whose properties were in its path.",

    "description": "Law enforcement agencies have not accused Donald Trump of any wrongdoing related to Jeffrey Epstein, and he has never been identified as a target of any associated investigation.\n\nIt was the summer of 1996 when Maria Farmer went to law enforcement to complain about Jeffrey Epstein. At the time, she said, she had been sexually assaulted by Epstein and his longtime partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. Farmer, then in her mid-20s, had also learned about a troubling encounter that her younger sister -- then a teenager -- had endured at Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. And she described facing threats from Epstein. Farmer said that when she discussed her concerns with the New York Police Department, then with the FBI, she also urged them to take a broader look at the people in Epstein's orbit, including Donald Trump, then still two decades from being elected president.

But she said she was alarmed by what she saw as Epstein's pattern of pursuing girls and young women while building friendships with prominent people, including Trump and President Bill Clinton.\n\nInvestigations like the ones that targeted Epstein often explore a wide range of tips, evidence, recollections and relationships, little of which ends up being used in court records or as the basis for criminal prosecution.

    "title": "Optimization and benefit evaluation model of a cloud computing-based platform for power enterprises - Scientific Reports",
    "description": "An integrated design scheme for a cloud computing platform tailored to power enterprises is proposed, combining an optimization scheduling mechanism with a performance evaluation model. This research addresses a central question: in the complex, resource-sensitive operational environment of power enterprises, how can the elastic computing capabilities of cloud technology and container orchestration mechanisms be leveraged to achieve system-level performance optimization under dynamic workload, failure, and cost constraints? To answer this question, an optimization model is developed that focuses on path scheduling, task load management, and elastic resource allocation. Simultaneously, a performance evaluation index system is constructed, encompassing three structural layers -- power generation, grid operations, and end-user services. This system facilitates quantitative analysis of platform performance by holistically assessing cost control, resource utilization, and security metrics. In comparison with existing approaches -- such as migration-based design frameworks10, equipment parameter optimization methods11, and monitoring platform concepts12 -- the model proposed in this research exhibits superior industrial adaptability, characterized by architectural integration and compatibility with multiple objectives. Through the incorporation of a lightweight optimization algorithm and a distributed real-time decision-making mechanism, the proposed model addresses common limitations of traditional systems, including high coupling, elevated operational costs, and insufficient flexibility. This research fills both theoretical and practical gaps in system-level optimization and benefit evaluation for cloud computing platforms in the power industry. Furthermore, it provides a replicable technical pathway and empirical foundation for promoting the transition toward more intelligent, efficient, and cost-effective operations.\n\nTo enhance resource utilization and reduce platform operational costs, various load balancing and cost control mechanisms have been implemented. The platform employs Nginx services alongside Kubernetes' built-in load balancing modules to dynamically distribute incoming requests across multiple backend computing nodes. Real-time monitoring of system resource utilization is achieved through the integration of Prometheus and Grafana. By adopting a workload-based HPA mechanism, the system automatically adjusts resource allocation in response to fluctuations in task volume, thereby minimizing resource wastage. In terms of cost control, the platform makes extensive use of Spot instances and reserved instances offered by cloud service providers. Intelligent task allocation strategies -- based on task criticality and latency requirements -- are employed to reduce long-term operational expenditures. Additionally, certain non-critical and non-real-time tasks are offloaded to edge computing nodes, thereby alleviating pressure on core computing resources and further reducing cost.\n\nResearch on the application of cloud computing in power enterprises has shown significant progress. Yahia et al. conducted pioneering work by transitioning traditional power grid planning and design platforms to a cloud computing environment. This approach enabled elastic resource allocation and high-performance computing, allowing power enterprises to optimize grid planning, improve equipment configuration, and address the complexities of power system operations. Tian et al. focused on optimizing power equipment design parameters through cloud-based computing. By utilizing large-scale cloud resources, rapid parameter optimization and simulation analysis were achieved, resulting in improved equipment performance and reduced energy consumption. Paukstadt and Becker developed a cloud-based simulation and monitoring platform for power systems, providing real-time operational monitoring and simulation analysis. Cloud services facilitated convenient access to system status, fault simulation, and timely system adjustments, thereby enhancing reliability and operational stability. Al-Wesabi et al. investigated the use of cloud computing in the planning of new energy power plants. They established a collaborative cloud-based design platform that supported multi-team coordination, improved design efficiency, and enabled information sharing and collaborative innovation. Mustapha et al. introduced a cloud-based power equipment health management platform by integrating sensor data with cloud-based monitoring systems. This platform enabled real-time equipment condition tracking, failure prediction, and remote maintenance services, ultimately reducing equipment downtime and maintenance costs. These studies demonstrate the diverse applications of cloud computing in the context of power enterprise design platforms, encompassing areas such as planning and design, equipment parameter optimization, system simulation and monitoring, collaborative development, and health management. Collectively, these advancements have contributed to improved operational efficiency, enhanced system performance, and the sustainable and innovative development of the power industry.\n\nPerformance evaluation in power enterprises is a complex and critical domain that involves multiple interrelated factors. Several recent studies have contributed to this field. Senjab et al. employed data mining techniques to analyze big data from power enterprises, aiming to establish more accurate performance evaluation models. These models utilize historical data to predict future performance and support informed decision-making. Yang et al. developed an intelligent operation and maintenance management system by integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology and artificial intelligence (AI). This system enabled real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of power equipment, thereby improving equipment availability and overall performance. In light of the growing emphasis on sustainability, Uslu et al. proposed indicators and models for assessing the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of power enterprises, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework. Devaraj et al. focused on the development of smart grids and assessed their benefits, including enhanced grid reliability and reduced energy waste, to support strategic decision-making in power enterprises. Jiao examined the competitive dynamics of the power market, providing performance evaluation and strategic insights for enterprises operating in highly competitive environments. This analysis included market structure, pricing strategies, and corporate performance indicators. These studies reflect the diversity and complexity of performance evaluation approaches in the power industry and highlight a growing trend toward integrating emerging technologies to support enterprise development.\n\nThe reviewed studies primarily focus on localized or domain-specific optimizations, such as parameter tuning, equipment health management, or collaborative platform design. While effective in their respective contexts, these approaches generally fall short of establishing a unified, multi-objective, and cross-departmental optimization framework. Moreover, few provide systematic comparisons of cloud architecture innovations or robust empirical validation of performance outcomes. In contrast, the cloud-based optimization and benefit evaluation model proposed in this research offers a more integrated and system-level approach. It constructs a multi-layered performance evaluation system spanning power generation, grid operations, and end-user applications, and incorporates dynamic optimization algorithms and lightweight scheduling mechanisms. This enables high-performance responsiveness and effective cost control under diverse workload and failure conditions. Compared with existing methodologies, the proposed model demonstrates superior scalability and practical applicability in terms of computational architecture, evaluation scope, and optimization efficiency. This research addresses critical gaps in the current literature by presenting a comprehensive framework capable of supporting industrial-scale deployment and cross-system assessment. Its contribution lies not only in technical performance but also in advancing theoretical and methodological understanding, offering a more universal solution for the digital transformation of power enterprises.\n\nThe motivation for this research arises from the complex and unprecedented challenges facing power enterprises in the context of ongoing digital transformation. As society advances and technological development accelerates, the power industry encounters not only emerging opportunities but also significant obstacles, including massive data volumes, uncertain market demand, and the inability of traditional design platforms to meet evolving business requirements. In this rapidly changing environment, power enterprises require more adaptable, efficient, and sustainable solutions to navigate current and future challenges. Accordingly, this research responds to the urgent need for digital transformation by focusing on the optimization of design platforms to enhance operational efficiency, increase flexibility, and promote sustainable innovation. By addressing core issues in the industry's transformation, this research aims to provide effective solutions to support power enterprises in overcoming both existing and anticipated difficulties.\n\nIn parallel, the research emphasizes the integration of cloud computing technology, which represents a leading trend in the contemporary information technology domain. The elastic resource provisioning and distributed computing capabilities of cloud platforms offer new possibilities for improving the design platforms of power enterprises. This integration is expected to overcome the limitations of traditional systems in handling large-scale data and complex business operations, thereby advancing power enterprises toward a future marked by increased efficiency, intelligence, and sustainability. The research is driven by a commitment to accelerating the adoption of advanced technologies in the power sector, with the goal of achieving more holistic, innovative, and sustainable development outcomes.\n\nThis research proposes a comprehensive and cloud-based design platform tailored for power enterprises, addressing critical challenges related to operational efficiency, flexibility, cost control, and sustainability in the context of digital transformation. Central to this platform are advanced load balancing and cost optimization mechanisms designed to ensure efficient resource utilization and minimize operational expenses. To distribute user requests efficiently, the platform integrates Nginx services with Kubernetes' native load balancing modules. Real-time monitoring and visualization of resource usage are achieved through a system built on Prometheus and Grafana. To adapt to workload fluctuations, the platform employs a HPA mechanism that dynamically adjusts computing resources, thereby preventing resource waste and improving responsiveness. For cost optimization, the system strategically leverages Spot instances and reserved instances provided by cloud service vendors. Task scheduling is based on task priority and interruptibility, allowing the system to allocate resources intelligently and significantly reduce long-term operational costs. Furthermore, certain low-priority and non-real-time tasks are offloaded to edge computing nodes, thereby alleviating the computational burden on core platform components and further reducing overall cloud resource costs.\n\nThis research, through a comprehensive analysis of the current state of digital transformation and the challenges facing the power industry, proposes an integrated solution aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability of power enterprises. A central focus of the research is the adoption of cloud computing technology. Beyond identifying its potential applications in power design platforms, the research proposes innovative implementation strategies to maximize the benefits of elastic resource allocation and distributed computing inherent to cloud architectures.\n\nTo further improve resource utilization and reduce platform operational costs, a combination of load balancing and cost control mechanisms has been implemented. The platform employs Nginx services alongside Kubernetes' built-in load balancing modules to dynamically distribute incoming external requests across multiple backend computing nodes. In conjunction with Prometheus and Grafana, real-time system resource monitoring is achieved. Leveraging a HPA mechanism based on workload conditions, the system dynamically adjusts resource allocation, scaling up or down in response to task volume, thus minimizing resource waste. From a cost management perspective, the platform extensively utilizes Spot instances and reserved instances provided by cloud service vendors. Through intelligent task allocation strategies that consider task type and interruptibility, long-term operational costs are significantly reduced. Additionally, by offloading non-critical, non-time-sensitive tasks to edge computing nodes, the system not only enhances overall cost efficiency but also ensures improved load distribution across the computing infrastructure.\n\nThis research also introduces a multi-level benefit evaluation model that accounts for the complex and diverse demands of power enterprises. The model provides decision-makers with a more accurate and comprehensive tool for assessing performance and guiding strategic decisions. By embedding sustainability assessment into the evaluation framework, the model promotes balanced development across economic, environmental, and social dimensions, offering holistic guidance for enterprises striving toward sustainable transformation.\n\nTo respond adaptively to fluctuating workloads, the system employs a HPA mechanism, which dynamically scales computing resources based on real-time demand. This approach prevents overprovisioning and minimizes resource waste. For cost optimization, the platform extensively utilizes Spot instances and reserved instances provided by cloud service vendors. By implementing a resource scheduling strategy based on task interruptibility, the system significantly reduces long-term operational expenditures. Moreover, low-priority and non-real-time tasks are offloaded to edge computing nodes, which helps relieve the computational burden on core platform resources and further lowers overall cloud infrastructure costs.\n\nArchitecturally, the platform adopts a layered design aligned with cloud computing paradigms. It consists of four primary layers:\n\nIn terms of security, the platform employs OAuth 2.0 for unified user authentication and access control. Data security is further strengthened through the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and encryption technologies, safeguarding system integrity and confidentiality.\n\nThe platform adopts a cloud computing-based layered architecture, designed to ensure scalability, flexibility, and high availability in power enterprise applications. It is structured into four primary layers: the user layer, platform service layer, resource scheduling layer, and infrastructure layer. The user layer provides a unified web-based access portal through which designers and project managers can submit tasks, monitor progress, and retrieve results. This interface ensures intuitive interaction and transparent task management throughout the operational workflow. The platform service layer encompasses key functional modules such as CAD, process management, and data analytics. These services are deployed using a microservice architectures based on Spring Cloud and Kubernetes, which ensures the scalability and modular decoupling of platform components. The resource scheduling layer integrates Docker containers with Kubernetes clusters to support containerized deployment and dynamic resource allocation, thereby enhancing platform's responsiveness and operational flexibility. At the infrastructure level, the platform leverages computing and storage resources from leading IaaS cloud providers, such as Alibaba Cloud and Huawei Cloud, to ensure high availability and elasticity. To safeguard platform security, the system employs the OAuth 2.0 protocol for unified authentication and access control, supplemented by VPNs and data encryption mechanisms to effectively mitigate the risk of data breaches.\n\nThe resource scheduling layer integrates Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters to enable containerized deployment, automatic orchestration, and elastic resource allocation. This dynamic scheduling mechanism enhances the platform's responsiveness to fluctuating workloads and ensures high availability of services. The infrastructure layer is built on mainstream IaaS cloud platforms, including Alibaba Cloud and Huawei Cloud. It provides reliable and elastic computing, storage, and network resources, supporting stable and scalable system performance. To ensure security and data integrity, the platform adopts the OAuth 2.0 protocol for unified user authentication and access control. This is further reinforced by the use of VPNs and data encryption technologies, which collectively safeguard against data breaches and unauthorized access.",

Furthermore, certain low-priority and non-real-time tasks are offloaded to edge computing nodes, thereby alleviating the computational burden on core platform components and further reducing overall cloud resource costs.\n\nThis research, through a comprehensive analysis of the current state of digital transformation and the challenges facing the power industry, proposes an integrated solution aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability of power enterprises. A central focus of the research is the adoption of cloud computing technology. Beyond identifying its potential applications in power design platforms, the research proposes innovative implementation strategies to maximize the benefits of elastic resource allocation and distributed computing inherent to cloud architectures.\n\nTo further improve resource utilization and reduce platform operational costs, a combination of load balancing and cost control mechanisms has been implemented. The platform employs Nginx services alongside Kubernetes' built-in load balancing modules to dynamically distribute incoming external requests across multiple backend computing nodes. In conjunction with Prometheus and Grafana, real-time system resource monitoring is achieved. Leveraging a HPA mechanism based on workload conditions, the system dynamically adjusts resource allocation, scaling up or down in response to task volume, thus minimizing resource waste. From a cost management perspective, the platform extensively utilizes Spot instances and reserved instances provided by cloud service vendors. Through intelligent task allocation strategies that consider task type and interruptibility, long-term operational costs are significantly reduced. Additionally, by offloading non-critical, non-time-sensitive tasks to edge computing nodes, the system not only enhances overall cost efficiency but also ensures improved load distribution across the computing infrastructure.\n\nThis research also introduces a multi-level benefit evaluation model that accounts for the complex and diverse demands of power enterprises. The model provides decision-makers with a more accurate and comprehensive tool for assessing performance and guiding strategic decisions. By embedding sustainability assessment into the evaluation framework, the model promotes balanced development across economic, environmental, and social dimensions, offering holistic guidance for enterprises striving toward sustainable transformation.\n\nTo respond adaptively to fluctuating workloads, the system employs a HPA mechanism, which dynamically scales computing resources based on real-time demand. This approach prevents overprovisioning and minimizes resource waste. For cost optimization, the platform extensively utilizes Spot instances and reserved instances provided by cloud service vendors. By implementing a resource scheduling strategy based on task interruptibility, the system significantly reduces long-term operational expenditures. Moreover, low-priority and non-real-time tasks are offloaded to edge computing nodes, which helps relieve the computational burden on core platform resources and further lowers overall cloud infrastructure costs.\n\nArchitecturally, the platform adopts a layered design aligned with cloud computing paradigms. It consists of four primary layers:\n\nIn terms of security, the platform employs OAuth 2.0 for unified user authentication and access control. Data security is further strengthened through the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and encryption technologies, safeguarding system integrity and confidentiality.\n\nThe platform adopts a cloud computing-based layered architecture, designed to ensure scalability, flexibility, and high availability in power enterprise applications. It is structured into four primary layers: the user layer, platform service layer, resource scheduling layer, and infrastructure layer. The user layer provides a unified web-based access portal through which designers and project managers can submit tasks, monitor progress, and retrieve results. This interface ensures intuitive interaction and transparent task management throughout the operational workflow. The platform service layer encompasses key functional modules such as CAD, process management, and data analytics. These services are deployed using a microservice architectures based on Spring Cloud and Kubernetes, which ensures the scalability and modular decoupling of platform components. The resource scheduling layer integrates Docker containers with Kubernetes clusters to support containerized deployment and dynamic resource allocation, thereby enhancing platform's responsiveness and operational flexibility. At the infrastructure level, the platform leverages computing and storage resources from leading IaaS cloud providers, such as Alibaba Cloud and Huawei Cloud, to ensure high availability and elasticity. To safeguard platform security, the system employs the OAuth 2.0 protocol for unified authentication and access control, supplemented by VPNs and data encryption mechanisms to effectively mitigate the risk of data breaches.\n\nThe resource scheduling layer integrates Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters to enable containerized deployment, automatic orchestration, and elastic resource allocation.

    "title": "NASA-Funded Greenland Survey Reveals 'Crazy' Amounts Of Ocean Warming",
    "description": "Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights.\n\nPreliminary data from a NASA-funded Greenland survey point to a two-degree centigrade rise in regional ocean water temperatures in less than a decade.\n\nFor the first time ever, a team of researchers took the data from a subglacial Greenland channel in February of this year using a custom-built, remotely operated vehicle equipped with sonar, laser-ranging and a mass spectrometer.\n\nPreliminarily, what we've been able to show is, at least during this year, ocean water in this region is almost two degrees warmer than it was less than 10 years ago, Britney Schmidt, a Cornell University astrobiologist and the ongoing Icefin project's principal investigator, tells me in Reykjavik. It's crazy amounts of warming; we're losing this ice very rapidly and it's much warmer than I would have expected; two degrees in 10 years is insane, she says.\n\nThe ROV allows us to find channels that are bringing water out from underneath the ice sheet which has huge climate implications, Schmidt tells me during the recent European Astrobiology Institute's BEACON 25 conference in Iceland. But it also has astrobiological implications, because you're bringing samples from under the ice sheet that we otherwise can't get to, she says.\n\nThis ROV exploration is also trailblazing the way for NASA's potential subsurface lander missions to the icy moons of Europa and Enceladus. At the same time, this research is providing the most current data on climate change in our Northern hemisphere.\n\nOne of these glaciers has been moving back at about a kilometer a year; others are moving faster, but this system is quite unstable, so we're rapidly losing ice, says Schmidt.\n\nNASA-funded and partly funded by the private Simons Foundation, one aim of the research is to simulate the types of exploration, decision making, and analyses that might be required for a mission one of our solar system's icy moons.\n\nWorking from temporary headquarters atop Greenland's ice cap, the team made its measurements earlier this year by deploying the ROV into subsurface channels and steering the ROV upstream underneath the ice sheet. The team worked near or on three glaciers, including the Knud Rasmussen Glacier on Greenland's Northwestern Coast\n\nWe're able to resolve exactly how the ocean is getting into these channels and how much fresh water is affecting the base of the ice, says Schmidt. That allows us to put much tighter constraints on how melting is happening, she says.\n\nEven so, Greenland has been rapidly losing ice for the last 100 years due to direct human-caused effects in the Northern hemisphere.\n\nThree glaciers are calving (or losing) ice directly into the ocean.\n\nIn the cold part of the season, the team can drive out on snowmobiles to these environments, Schmidt explains in her BEACON 25 talk. The team first drills a hole in the sea ice, then we deploy the vehicle vertically through the ice, then drive it under the ice horizontally, as Schmidt explains in her talk.\n\nThe ways in which we're exploring beneath the ice are analogous to the types of things we'd need to develop to explore Jupiter and Saturn's icy moons, says Schmidt. You'd melt through the ice shell to be able to pull water samples and decide which samples are interesting and then pass the most interesting ones through to in-situ life detection instrumentation, she says.\n\nAt the same time, this work is helping the team develop new sample handling systems that oceanographers and climatologists can use on Earth.\n\nMass spectrometers pull in samples of material and analyze their chemistry. in this case, it's what's called a membrane inlet (semi-permeable) mass spectrometer, says Schmidt. It's pulling dissolved gases out of the water and analyzing their composition, she says. That allows us to do is to understand what's going on underneath the ice and measure just how much melting is happening underneath the glaciers, she notes.\n\nThis basic research will also help further NASA's laundry list of tech development needed to manage eventual subsurface sampling of Europa and Enceladus.\n\nHow would a subsurface rover on the icy moons of Europa or Enceladus communicate back to Earth?\n\nIt would probably need a tether or a set of acoustic transponders that can transit through the ice to allow it to radio back to the surface and then radio out back to Earth, says Schmidt. But it's possible, she says.\n\nBut before such ambitious space missions to Europa or Enceladus, there's practical work to do here on Earth. One involves enabling AI for the Icefin ROV so that it can make at least some of its own exploration decisions in situ.\n\nWe have a long way to go on under-ice robotic autonomy, both from just how to keep vehicles safe to how to understand the environment, says Schmidt. That's kind of a frontier, not just for space exploration, but also for Earth exploration, she says.",
